## Citizen-Led, Independent

SupportPMCH is a citizen-led grassroots initiative to ensure that residents of Petoskey are provided the level of transparency they deserve around the conduct of the PSP School board. We are separate and independent of The Petoskey Montessori Children's House, as well as it's Board of Trustee's.

The opinions expressed here belong solely to SupportPMCH, and are not official positions or statements on the part of PMCH BOT or PMCH staff. Editorial control is at the sole discretion of SupportPMCH and it's management.

We understand that our positions might come across as overly firm. We hope that you understand that we've come to this effort as a last result, after over a year of waiting for the PSP board to work amiably with the PMCH BOT, only to learn time and again of duplicitous behavior. The system that should work for us is failing, as a result we intend to investigate the circumstances, this site will serving as public documentation of that process and our findings.

## Mission Statement

The purpose of this project is to focus resources and efforts upon the task of persuading the Public Schools of Petoskey School Board into renewing and strengthening it's commitment to the Petoskey Montessori Children's House.

## Executive Summary

The Public Schools of Petoskey has expressed a lack of interest in renewing it's support in the form of a management contract for Petoskey Montessori Children's House. The consequences of this action are wide ranging, but foremost it represents the risk of losing Mr Russel Carpenter as the Elementary classroom Teacher.

## Objectives

- Identify points of contention
- Address the collected concerns here
- Outline the extensive amazing things happening at PMCH
- Provide easy access to people to voice support for PMCH to their local elected officials
