Dear Petoskey Montessori Community,

We want to thank those who participated in the February Public Schools of Petoskey board meeting and to those who have been advocating for our school in other ways such as through letter writing, phone calls, and social media. We are so proud of our community; you have made thoughtful, compelling, and passionate statements in support of our school and we are grateful your voices were heard.

After the school board meeting, several people asked for clarification on some of the information presented by Dr. Leslie. We thought this information might be useful to all and we figured the easiest way to respond was through a letter with supporting documents so that we could reach the most people efficiently and you could review whatever data you are most interested in. We apologize in advance but this is going to be a long one –we want you to have the information in the clearest and most succinct way, but there is a lot of data we have been using to make decisions and want to be as transparent as possible. We will schedule another town hall style meeting to offer an opportunity to discuss in person as well.

To our knowledge, the Montessori has been on a contract that renews every two years with the Public Schools of Petoskey since the inception of the management agreement 25 years ago. After speaking with past board members we don’t believe that the agreement was ever updated. We will include it in the attachments, but it essentially allows the public schools to take a 20% management fee, $150 for an annual audit, the teacher/ guide’s salary and benefits and gives the remaining money to the Montessori to operate the classroom. The Agreement also stipulates that funding should be equitable to other schools in the district,  but that appears to leave a lot up for interpretation as there isn’t a calculation for that stipulation, just the per pupil allowance. When reviewing the numbers, we found that our students were not receiving the same level of funding that was distributed to other elementary schools in the way of specific millages and other funds like the federal early literacy COVID supports or the enhancement millage.

As a board, we have a fiduciary responsibility to the school. When we saw the numbers, and reviewed industry standards for management agreements, we felt it was our responsibility to our students to ask for a more equitable share during the biannual contract renewal. For reference, the industry standard for a management fee is 7-11% and the managing party typically provides things such as HR support, IT, grant management, and payroll services.

At a time parallel to discussing the management agreement, the PMCH board was dreaming of a new school building. The current structure needs a lot of repairs and if we are going to continue to serve families into the future, we will need a new building. Because we are passionate about the Montessori Method and are acutely aware of the childcare crisis, we discussed expanding the programs. Perhaps naively, we thought the public schools would share our enthusiasm for expanded Montessori options.

Our enthusiasm translated into a proposal (see attachment) for a modification of the management agreement that we thought was creative and could meet a lot of mutual needs. We spent a significant amount of time and utilized the professional skills and experience of the members of our board and other experts when developing the initial proposal. Specifically, board member Sarah Campbell, the COO of Champion Education who works daily in the world of school funding, and former CFO of Petoskey Public Schools, Branden Wheeler. This is the proposal which prompted a lot of questions after Dr. Leslie referred to it in his discussion at the school board meeting. To be clear, this was a proposal and not an ultimatum. When the public schools rejected the proposal and counter-offered a 5% management fee the PMCH Board agreed. As Dr. Leslie indicated when he spoke, the PMCH board followed up several times to find out the status of signatures on the agreement; we did not cause a delay as some felt was insinuated.

From our perspective, our proposal was the beginning step towards negotiations and never intended as a demand as it seems to have been interpreted. While we wouldn’t normally share emails in a public forum, we feel the tone of the introduction of the proposal was misrepresented in the school board meeting last week.  We heard there was concern that the emails that were flashed on the screen may have supported the argument that we were adversarial. Thus, we are including the email exchange in the attachments for your review.

We didn’t engage an attorney to present the proposal but instead, presented it in person, first to Dr. Leslie and then again to Dr. Leslie and school board member Jenni Attie.  Until the February 15 school board meeting, it had never been brought to our attention that the proposal may have been misconstrued. We were as surprised as everyone in the room when Dr. Leslie indicated that we asked for upwards of a $300,000 increase. When we got home we were able to compare his statements to previous conversations and the proposal and we think we have a sense of what he was referring to. As you can see in slide 8 of the proposal, we asked for $14,000 per pupil to be equitable to the other elementary schools as we currently receive much less than the other elementaries per student.

We reached the $14,000/pupil amount, which was previously stated, as a negotiation point, after a thorough review of the publicly available financial data. We used the information from the parent dashboard on MI School Data and the transparency reporting. If you follow both of the links you will be able to see per pupil expenditures by school and PSP’s budget and expenditure breakdown. As seen on MI School Data, PMCH received $6,248 per pupil during the 21-22 school year and all other PSP Elementary schools received at least $13,114 per pupil in the same time period. This means that PMCH was allocated less than half the funds used at the other K-5 schools.

Money for Michigan schoolchildren is distributed in several buckets –schools receive a baseline for every student enrolled in the district –this is called the State Aid Foundation Allowance. The state may also distribute extra funds called categorical funds.  When reviewing disbursements, we noted that PMCH’s allocation is less than the baseline per pupil allocation from the state (the State Aid Foundation Allowance). In 2021-2022, the year used as an example above, the foundation allowance was $8,700 ([reference](https://www.mischooldata.org/foundation-allowance/)). This does not include any of the categorical payments. For context, during the school board meeting the additional categorical funds were the monies that the finance director expressed surprise about the high value this year.

We determined that given the increasing State Aid Foundation Allowance that $14,000 was a fair ask. The average PSP Elementary school was allocated $13,558 and the baseline per pupil amount increased year over year (+$450 in 22-23, +$458 in 23-24). Since the Management Agreement stipulated “The Board has determined that the enrollment at, and funding of, the Montessori School must be equitable” (pg. 7) we thought we would start at an amount the other schools receive.

To be fair, $14,000 per student would put us around the mark Dr. Leslie referenced but we were not asking for the change in per pupil reimbursement in addition to what we are already receiving. We simply thought this was a more straightforward request and would best protect our interests since there were multiple interpretations of equitable disbursement in the past.

We believe slide 8 may also be what prompted Dr. Leslie to say that we asked PSP to “cover a mortgage” as it includes a line item on rent as well as other costs of hosting the elementary school (including a mortgage). We thought we were helping the district by showing the components PMCH paid for the building including current costs of a mortgage and projections for insurance. This presentation was created in April 2023; PMCH was able to pay off its mortgage in October 2023.  This presentation was again, created to be a starting point for negotiations. We wanted to lay all the cards on the table with PSP regarding the costs that were being incurred in April 2023 to illustrate how we reached the pro-rata rent amount. In the past there hadn’t been that level of communication and we were informed that it was needed.

At the second meeting with Dr. Leslie and Jenni Attie, Dr. Leslie informed Trustees Byron and Monshor that PSP would engage their attorney to review the existing contract and proposal terms. This was the first introduction  of attorneys to the process. As is the common way with negotiations, we anticipated a back and forth to help recover some of our funds. Our attorneys went back and forth a couple times, but we received no formal response until PSP landed on the end result of an addendum to the contract agreeing to a 5% management fee for one more year and that it was “anticipated” that the agreement would not be renewed (see attachment).  From our perspective, both parties believed that the 25 year old contract was outdated and needed to be updated but this was the first notice that no further negotiations would occur.

PMCH board reached out to the Public School Board to determine if there was a path forward and Mark Ashley offered a meeting to discuss ideas. On November 16th, 2023 Jessi Kuhlman and Nicky Byron met with Kathy Reed (PSP School Board), Mark Ashley (PSP School Board President), Dr. Leslie, Bill Melching (PSP Finance Director) & Becky Smith (PSP Director of Teaching and Learning) at the Spitler Building; Rebecca Roth joined by phone for the first hour of the meeting.

We assumed that we would be discussing financials, however, the concerns mentioned were largely operational. Leaving that meeting, our understanding of the primary concerns were:
-The differences in Montessori philosophy from the traditional schools and variance in curriculum use
-Kindergarten students not having a PSP teacher
-The school administrator isn’t a certified teacher
-PSP not being involved in assessing the children’s readiness to transition from grade to grade or assessing them for special needs
-Ability to manage any additional restricted funds like the enhancement millage

There was a brief discussion of finances when Dr.  Leslie explicitly asked if we were continuing to seek our financial proposal and we stated “no, we are happy with the 5%”.

We did not leave the meeting with a firm sense of whether the PSP would be willing to continue to work on the agreement but were hopeful that we could address these issues as this was the first we had heard of the concerns and because they had not publicly declared plans to sever the relationship between the public schools and PMCH.

We immediately followed up on the concerns; Mary Jo had already been working to renew her teacher’s certificate which she completed 3 weeks later.  We conveyed the curriculum and advancement concerns with Mr. Russell and encouraged discussion with his PSP colleagues if given the opportunity. Given the advancements, and our eagerness to continue discussions, we coordinated a follow up meeting to discuss proposed solutions for their concerns.

Nicky Byron and Rebecca Roth from the PMCH board met with Mark Ashley, Kathy Reed, Dr. Leslie and Becky Smith on January 30th, 2024. We provided updates on Mary Jo’s teaching certificate and asked to discuss and problem-solve remaining concerns. The meeting again focused on operational concerns. Dr. Leslie remained silent for most of the meeting. Finances were not discussed at all and the finance director was not present. At this meeting, Mark Ashley said that the board had no plans to continue an agreement. We asked if the board had voted on it and if there would be public discussion. He said that it had been decided on when they reviewed the last management agreement but agreed to put it on an upcoming school board agenda as there had been no public discussion. We asked how Russell would be notified and we asked about how kids would be transitioned. Nicky Byron informed them she would be out of town in February and we asked if it could be on the March agenda.

The tone of these meetings was always professional and cordial.

Thus, while it was represented in the PSP school board meeting that finances are the main barrier for renewing our management agreement, this was not the information conveyed to us during any in person conversations from the PSP board. We did hear various iterations of operational targets, test scores, special education interventions, decreased enrollment, and the philosophy not meshing with the prescribed curriculum of PSP. Attempts to engage in brainstorming for solutions to any of the above were unfortunately and bafflingly not successful.

Everyone in our PMCH community is welcome to attend our board meetings. They are scheduled for the second Tuesday each month at 5:30. To accommodate space for those that wish to attend, please email the board or a board member beforehand so we can plan for a proper location.

It is also worth noting that our proposals and email correspondence were all agreed upon by the board, not any one board member acting alone. To claim that any one person’s actions or communication style caused a breakdown in negotiations is erroneous and unseemly. It felt very purposeful and unkind that one board member who the public schools knew would not be present to defend herself was very publicly targeted. Most of us on the board joined under the premise  that the commitment would be 1-2 hours a month which would focus on school improvement and fundraising. We did not anticipate uncovering a lengthy embezzlement scheme, related court case, managing licensing and HR challenges, managing building issues and now a heated challenge with the public schools. The time commitment needed to keep PMCH open has been daunting and has impacted our families and work. Broad accusations of lack of transparency or ill intent without opportunity to discuss concerns are hurtful.

We maintain that we have been straightforward and truthful to our community. Our own children are part of this community and we are doing everything we can to maintain the relationship with PSP. We will continue to be the best champions we can be and are always open to input from our amazing PMCH community.
