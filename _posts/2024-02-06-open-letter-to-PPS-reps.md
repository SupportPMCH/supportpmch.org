Dear Representatives of the Public Schools of Petoskey,

The purpose of this letter is to inform you that we, the community of Petoskey, are organizing against intended actions to be taken on our behalf under the direction of the leadership of the Public Shools of Petoskey School District. The purpose of our action is to cause the reversal of the decision to not renew the Management Agreement with Petoskey Montessori Children's House. Should we fail in that effort, we will seek comfort in the exposure of the personal agenda's working behind the scenes to undermine the PMCH.

The Michigan Revised School Code 380.507 part 7 makes clear that there is little to no legal liability posed to the Petoskey Public School District in not renewing this agreement. As a result of this fact, we are left with only the court of public opinion. To that end, we intend to conduct an aggressive public relations campaign, refuting the negative assertions made by the PSP and board members. We will also seek to prove that recent unfortunate events were only possible due to the gross negligence in fulfilling it's lawful duties, as defined in RSC 380.507 part 1 subsection D, specifically "The oversight shall be sufficient to ensure that the board of directors is in compliance with the terms of the contract and with applicable law." This board failed from as far back as 2018 to conduct reasonable and lawfully required fiscal oversight of a body under it's management. We will not tolerate the PSP attempts at laying all consequence at the feet of PMCH and at the cost of all of it's many and varied students.

This campaign will be well resourced, and focused on conducting investigative research in support of our initiatives. We will publish our findings on a public website, which we will also utilize to solicit additional support and leads to investigate. We will invite media opportunities to discuss this subject and bring attention to our cause. We will produce yard signs, bumper stickers, and assorted swag.

We have direct experience with a similar campaign with a local school board in the past, and we have paid staff who's efforts towards this cause will be counted towards on the job training time.
