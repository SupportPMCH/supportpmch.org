## Mission Statement

The purpose of this project is to focus resources and efforts upon the task of persuading the Public Schools of Petoskey School Board into renewing and strengthening it's commitment to the Petoskey Montessori Children's House.

## Executive Summary

The Public Schools of Petoskey has expressed a lack of interest in renewing it's support in the form of a management contract for Petoskey Montessori Children's House. The consequences of this action are wide ranging, but foremost it represents the risk of losing Mr Russel Carpenter as the Elementary classroom Teacher.

## Objectives

- Identify points of contention
- Address the collected concerns here
- Outline the extensive amazing things happening at PMCH
- Provide easy access to people to voice support for PMCH to their local elected officials
