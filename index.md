## Citizen-Led, Independent

SupportPMCH is a citizen-led grassroots initiative to ensure that residents of Petoskey are provided the level of transparency they deserve around the decision of the PSP School Board to not renew the management agreement with PMCH. We are separate and independent of The Petoskey Montessori Children's House, as well as it's Board of Trustee's.

The opinions expressed here belong solely to SupportPMCH, and are not official positions or statements on the part of PMCH BOT or PMCH staff. Editorial control is at the sole discretion of SupportPMCH and it's management.
