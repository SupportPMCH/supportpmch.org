[SIDE CONVERSATIONS] Hi, everybody.

Thanks for being here tonight.

If you plan to make public comment, we're going to ask that you fill one of these out.

So that way, we make sure you get your name right and how to contact you.

So those of you that have some, thank you very much.

Does anybody else want one right now?

I get paid extra for this part.

There's some that are out there on the table, but if you'd like to read these.

Is it so we can speak?

Yeah.

OK.

It's just we want to make sure we get names right and everything else.

[SIDE CONVERSATIONS] Yes, a husband and wife.

Yeah, and if you just want to hold on to them, that's totally fine.

You don't have to turn them in.

But we just want to make sure that we have them by the end of the evening.

[SIDE CONVERSATIONS] So there's some others up here, and there's some out there.

Thank you very much.

[SIDE CONVERSATIONS] [SIDE CONVERSATIONS] our.

Yeah I think we're just meeting to order.

Let the records show that all of the trustees are here.

We're gonna stand for the Pledge of Allegiance.

I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands one nation under God, the indivisible with liberty and justice for all.

Alright, so our first order of business is audience participation and participation by the audience is welcome and encouraged.

Please go to this time.

This time is for board members to listen to public comment, not to respond to comments.

Two opportunities for public comment are provided at each board meeting.

When participating in public comment, members of the audience are to identify themselves by name and address so the accurate minutes can be recorded.

Unless permission is previously received on the board of education, comments will be limited to three minutes.

I will, since there's a lot of us that will be doing comments this evening, I believe I will have a little timer on you so we'll let you finish your comments but just a little three minutes will be adhered to.

For those who prefer not to speak at the board meeting yet want their questions or comments conveyed to the board, a green memo to the board form is provided and is asked out by the entrance.

Please note the public comment time and the members of the board are provided to allow board members to listen to public comment, not respond to comments.

We do have these comments here.

We do have it at both opportunities now and at the end of the meeting.

So, while we do have some of these blue sheets here and I'll go through some of these if you're saying you'd like to wait for your comments to be later, that's totally fine.

If you'd like to do it now, you may do it now and you may choose to stand where you are or you may choose to come up here and stand at the podium.

The people in the back have asked us to talk loudly.

That's the reason I'm trying to talk a little louder.

So, just remember that.

So, we have some sheets here and I will apologize before I mess up the names but.

.

.

[inaudible] Sorry.

[inaudible] So, hi, I'm Lauren.

I'm a freshman in high school and I'm coming to preschool?

Three years old.

I have to say at some point that I wanted to know what a normal school is like but I'm really glad that I can't expect to be in that school.

I asked my dad in the argument when he said that it does not bother him in high school when he was sitting at high school and he said it's going to happen to me.

And I finished every single year with all my fall honors classes right now.

He's hired the most people in my family.

I'm going to start thinking about this because the fact that we may fall in line so it gets me wet because it really does get you in the comments on social skills.

But I feel like if you have any line stories that are significant in this school and I feel like it's a really hard thing to say but it doesn't prepare you because I think any live stuff in life you'll never be prepared for something.

But I think that our words are really important.

I always consider my lessons for a lesson.

I'm always going to remember them because we would be the only ones who would sit with me while I try to argue with him about fractions.

I struggled with them a lot when I was doing that.

I feel like there are other problems that the schools could focus on when going to that kind of school.

And I understand something that I think is a little bit weird, a little bit different from something that happened.

But something that I think that does work and I think there's a lot of people here and a lot of students that can say that.

Thank you for that.

Thank you very much.

I appreciate your comments.

So, James, Kenny, and Lauren.

My name is Kim.

I'm a student at Montessori.

I have been to two other schools.

After that other schools they made me feel over-bragged and unclothed.

I love them because of how many good ideas of what they are.

There are a lot of other things that they can do, like cooking.

And I hope that you make the decision to keep the schools the way they are for other students who are going to work for the school.

Thank you very much.

Good hearing, guys.

Excuse me.

Did you want to say something else?

I'm going to get an open, so she knows I have a lot to say.

Alright, well you were on there too, so I'm sorry.

Yeah.

(speaking in foreign language) I stand here today as a community member.

I stand here as a student who first started at Holy Childhood as a mother of children who are first generation with education sovereignty.

As a mother of two students who started at Lincoln, PMS, and then PHS and a mother of a current Montessori student.

I'm going to give you all a teaching and it's because I've seen that this has come into such a big conflict on both sides.

So I want you to know that we are on the land of the Waganak-Sinodala.

You are a guest on our lands.

There are certain norms when you come here.

I wanted to share a teaching with all of you that my family has of what it means to be Ogechi Dao, because this seems like a fight.

Ogechi Dao, when you translate it, means warrior in Anishinaabemowin.

To be Ogechi Dao, you fight with your heart, your head, and your hands.

We use our hearts because we need to think about the actions as they affect those we love.

Our families, our communities, the greater community, the next generation.

We use our heads because without using your higher thinking for diplomacy and strategy, you will only get pain.

And we only use our hands as a last resort, because when you use your hands, it leads to pain in the community.

I stand in front of you this evening to let you know that some of the leadership of the Board of Trustees did not act in accordance with the rules of this land.

There were some who used their hands first.

They came swinging at the staff and all of you, and this was not productive.

It was an anger, frustration, and fear.

I ask that now all of you present know this teaching, that you use your heart and your head when considering the effects to the community during your conversations.

I ask that you stay true to your function in this community, which is to oversee the education of people in our community.

I ask that you stay true to your mission as the Board, which is to advance the education and skills of students in an equitable manner through participation, involvement of staff, students, parents, and others in the community.

And finally, I ask that you table any votes upon this subject so you can get true community involvement in understanding how your actions today will affect the next generations on this land.

Thank you.

[inaudible] Rebecca Roth.

That's a hard one to follow.

I come here as a parent and also to ask a non-story board member.

Do I have to get my address?

Okay.

So I live on Rosebud Lane and I also own a business on Shallow Lake.

I, um, this is a hard one.

My kids ended up at the Montessori in a sort of circular way as well as I think a lot of the kids have.

It's been a great experience for my kids.

And so I'm coming to appeal to you to really be curious and think about what it would look like to end this relationship.

They have flourished.

My kids were here and they have an older brother who transferred here when he was in the 8th grade and I really regret that we didn't move sooner because I think he would have absolutely flourished if I'm not a story.

I want to give a little story myself.

When I was early in my career, we had a clinic coordinator who always called who always cited the operational plan when we would have a hard decision to make.

We would fall in line with his decisions and we would say, oh, the operational plan says this, yep, let's do it.

After a while though, I noticed that the decisions didn't seem to be all that consistent.

And so I asked to see the operational plan and found out that a lot of the stuff he said wasn't actually in the operational plan.

That prompted me to really value curiosity and ask a lot of questions and make sure that we weren't just following suit because that was what he said and he had been around a long time.

And so I'm asking you as the board to ask questions.

Come ask us questions.

My kids ask me how can they shut us down without coming and talking to us and seeing what we do.

I think with the exception of Johnny, I don't think any of you have been there in the last ten years.

Or you've been there in the last, oh sorry.

So with the exception of Jenny and Kathy, I guess we've got ten years.

Has it been less than five, less than Kim had left?

You know I think it's important to look at how the kids are learning, what they're learning.

My son is very proud that he can do long division very young.

And then he's caught up with some of the other math.

So he's not on the trajectory that all the other kids are at, but he is on a trajectory that works for him.

And it's really, really important to us.

So I'm asking you to be curious and come in and ask the questions.

Ask us the questions.

Ask our kids the questions.

We want to answer them.

And I think that we can.

We love it because it supports the curiosity.

And we want to encourage you to be curious as well and come join us in that.

And if you don't like what the answers are then fine.

But at least ask the right questions.

Ask us the questions of why this works for our kids.

Because we truly believe it does.

Thank you.

[ silence ] I'm going to pause twice.

Sarah Kisho?

Sorry about that.

I just wanted to know, my daughter.

And my daughter and my grandchildren have all attended my family.

So I thought my daughter spoke very well.

So I'm just going to touch on some of the things that she was there.

Oh, she's very good.

When she was three years old.

And we lived in town.

She talked about the independence.

The love and responsibility that they teach there.

She is probably one of the most independent children that I have.

She takes very well care of herself.

And is very responsible with her homework.

She talked about her grades.

She's got straight A's.

She went into middle school and we had a very large family issue happen during that time.

And she successfully managed it.

The whole time successfully.

Straight A's the whole time.

She had a test the other day.

She didn't, honest, but she was speaking trigonometry.

And I asked her and she's like, oh, that's easy.

She's a freshman.

And she's telling me that trigonometry is easy.

I went to Russell's class and I would go sit in the front and they would teach you they would bring you in to teach you how they taught math.

How they did English.

How they made you have like little nights that the parents could come in and be a part of.

I did that.

I sat in front of the mountain.

I sat in front row and I could not figure out those cues that you have there.

And I could not conceptually like understand how to teach to help my daughter with her homework at some point.

She was in kindergarten and did twelve page reports on a northern pike fish.

Right?

So she he did such a good job with putting the cherry in front of her and just enough to where she wanted to learn more and do more and become more.

There was no end cap.

She excelled very well socially like I said, the responsibility she did very, very well.

So I just, you know, I'm really sad to hear that the thought of closing the Montessori because you would close off that option with all of these children that would come back from that.

I'm not sure why.

I can only guess it might be funding.

I just is curious if you looked at other ways to try and supplement that funding because there could be other ways out there.

Because look at the group here.

Like we're all here to support that.

So, big much for listening.

Thank you very much.

Liz Cohen?

Yes, I'm Liz Cohen.

I live at 5305 Old Island Road, Levering, 49755.

Yes, it is thirty-two minutes to the school and every bit is worth it.

So my fourth grade son attends classically as one of the ten school of choice students.

He's like a teen.

He's continuing on in Class B school district for Middleton High School.

He moves to the area just before his first grade year and actually the K-5 Montessori was a huge part of our decision to move.

I'm so grateful we found this generous ed school and his respect for children is unending and his devotion to helping them tap into their capabilities which are to move towards.

Kids at Montessori learn through tangible and engaging work which they themselves choose and initiate.

There are clear expectations that they finish the work they start and that they balance their time across a full range of subjects.

But within that, allowing for freedom of choice within the structure has nurtured my son's curiosity, his confidence, and his intrinsic motivation.

I want to share an example of that.

He struggled with reading in the second grade, beginning of second grade.

In addition to frequent reading lessons to help get him over the hurdle, Mr.

Carpenter also used his knack for weaving a child's interest into the learning.

Within a couple of months, my son went from pen and mudge to reading whole paragraphs out of adult field guides.

Mr.

Carpenter took note of that interest in field guides and they would walk around the play yard and they would look at tree leaves and try to identify them in a book.

My son would take notes on his findings.

His enthusiasm about leaves and pine cones and birds and bugs, whatever it was, helped him to learn to read and write out of an eagerness for knowledge, not for assignment.

Now his head is buried in a book much of the time, reference books, novels, poetry, whatever you like.

The other thing I want to highlight is the mixed-age classroom.

It's so important that kids work together as a community and they all have daily chores to keep the classroom clean and functioning.

The older ones may teach the younger ones during work time and my son often comes home beaming, telling me about helping a younger student with a reading assignment or a hands-on math project.

This not only reinforces his learning of the material for himself, but also allows him to practice the arts of collaboration and patience and listening.

The social skills are then honed further in the wider community through field trips.

When they go on to the food bank, they serve meals at the church, read to the residents at the assisted living facility.

Finally, to me, the Montessori You can finish your last little comment, but you're three minutes early.

It's about curiosity and hands-on investigation, mutual respect and a sense of place in the community.

It's about problem solving and collaboration.

In this Montessori spirit, I ask you to please listen to our perspectives and give us time to understand and remedy your concerns.

I ask you to proceed with us to find common ground and I sincerely appreciate your time.

Thank you for your time.

Lauren Carey?

Hi, I'm Lauren Carey I live at 13035 in Waukeek Street in Charlotte.

I'm here as a parent.

I have a third grade student at the Montessori school.

We drive from Charlotte twice a day to the homeless school because we feel like it's absolutely the best.

My daughter was home schooled for the first two years of our elementary and it's because of the Montessori that we've been able to stay in the area.

I've been a registered nurse for 20 years.

We've lived in urban and rural areas and the fact that we've got Montessori as an option in our tiny little corner of Northern Michigan is so incredibly important to us.

I get emotional trying to think about what that classroom would look like without Russell because he really loves the heart and soul of what goes on in that elementary classroom.

And it's not an exaggeration to say that it's been life changing and life saving from my daughter.

Her social skills have absolutely blossomed in this environment.

She comes home happy, excited to go to school.

I have an older child who is now an adult who went through the traditional school system in Charlotte.

That was never my experience.

It was like pulling teeth to get them out of bed every day.

And this has just been a joy and we look forward to it and we feel so grateful to have this opportunity.

I have a letter that I was going to read from another parent who can't be here so if I run out of time I'll try to get through her words as well as quickly as I can.

This is a letter from Tiffany Moore-Kortville and she says writing after learning that the contract for the Patoski Monastery may not be reviewed.

This news is incredibly sad and disappointing to me as a parent of former students of the Monastery School.

I have two children who completed the elementary program at Monastery attending from preschool to fifth grade.

My third child attended until I moved out of state at the end of the first grade year.

Our experience at Patoski Monastery and with the teacher Russell Carpenter was wonderful.

Our children learned well, scored in high percentiles on all of the NWEA tests.

They wanted to excel in high level courses including multiple AP and advanced level electives.

More important than that to me though are the independence, curiosity and leadership skills that the program taught.

My 16 year old is winning awards at Model UN speaking in front of over 70 students and adults.

My 14 year old has incredible empathy for others.

My 10 year old is active in programs where she knows no one but wants to try something new and exciting.

All of them directly link these schools back to their experiences in Monastery and still regularly talk excitedly about their time there.

The beauty and privilege of having the Monastery School as a choice to public school students in Patoski is that it gives more options to support different types of learners.

Of course the Monastery is not perfect for every student and there will be parents in the community who feel other schools are better fit.

As a mental health professional who has worked in schools in both Emmett and Antrim counties as well as districts in San Francisco, Ann Arbor and Rochester New York.

It is the same without question that parents will want to make building changes to find a better fit in every traditional public school which have worked.

It is a terrible shame that we need to take away options for alternative education styles for our children.

[ Inaudible ] Sorry about that.

Thank you for your comments.

Brienne Wozniak?

So I'm a parent of two young girls that attend the Monastery School.

But I am not reading a letter of my own.

I'm reading on behalf of Alicia Portville who I'm assuming is the daughter of the individual who spoke for us.

So, only my address.

Alright.

Dear Dr.

Leslie and members of the public schools of Patoski Board of Education.

I am writing this letter after hearing that Montessori may be removed from the Patoski Public Schools.

Since someone who spent her childhood there, I would never support that decision.

Six years ago in fifth grade, a young girl stood in front of store owners and convinced them to fund a Montessori option.

During the third quarter of the annual drill, she did what many businessmen could not.

And convinced dozens of adults to donate their most valuable resource, money.

Today I use her leadership skills to speak in front of over 70 people at Model UN cognitive and convince others to support my school mission to grow the school.

Six years ago, the same girl chose her work and was taught through visual and tactile examples.

I use this skill now to train you with dot diagrams to determine the properties of substances and their bond types.

Montessori's unique teaching style not only provides intelligence that meshes with both the real world and within school, but creates an environment that enhances kids, that entices kids to learn rather than forcing them.

On Sundays, my friends from other schools would complain about going to school and I could never relate.

I could not wait for my lesson.

As of 2023, I'm a junior and straight A student who is speaking PreCalculus Honors, AP Chem, AP Language, AP US History, AP World, Business 1 and 2, and Human Imagination Theology and Human Theory.

In addition to being a Model UN award winner, I am the co-founder of the science program that has spread to multiple local schools, and am on the executive board of the Student Council and participate in an environmental club in addition to playing some sports.

Access to quality education is arguably one of the most important aspects of a person's life, and elementary school is the foundation for all education moving forward.

Having a school that fully supported me and nourished all of my values, and an attitude that has been a part of my career, I have been able to participate in five football snowballs, inventing new games, and creating economies centered around tennis balls.

There was never just snow, there was thought that an answering request and reasoning was an answer that was given.

Unlike all of my friends, I have still regularly mentioned my own in school.

It still applies today, even in high school.

This region was the happiest time to know.

All children, not just those with money, should be able to access the level of education.

I fully argue that all schools should adopt policies and force them in Montessori, and to remove this format from passing public schools can be unfair to both children and their residents.

Sincerely, Alicia Portra Natalie Waltz Hi, my name is Natalie Waltz.

I live at 614 Drue, and I am part of the Totsu Montessori board.

So I'm going to speak a little bit more factually here.

We've heard that one of the reasons for the dissolving of the agreement is due to financial reasons, so I'm going to take that.

After spending many months reviewing the books and gaining insight from experts in school funding, we determined that the management agreement terms were outdated.

As such, we developed a proposal to present to Dr.

Leslie and the rest of the public schools at the Totsu board, and asked for an equitable amount to ensure our students receive the same financial support as other students in the district.

This is in accordance with the current management agreement that states, "funding of Montessori schools must be equitable.

" The public schools of Totsu engaged their attorneys to review the language and determine that further negotiation needed to occur, so we retained an attorney as well.

Negotiations continued over the summer until we were notified in August that TSP had elected simply not to renew the agreement after this year.

It was a very disappointing outcome, especially since we were not notified that next year's meeting had ceased.

Since then, we have had two additional meetings with TSP administrative staff and school board members, the first on December 4, 2023, and the second on January 30, 2024.

We've heard several reasons for non-renewal.

Financial reasons were briefly mentioned, but the meetings were focused mostly on oversight, curriculum, and testing concerns.

However, in the Petoskey News Review article published yesterday, the superintendent cited finances as the reason the agreement would be discontinued, so I'll focus on that.

For the last 25 years under the management agreement terms, TSP has 20% of the state foundation allowance that is allocated on a per-student basis.

That means we are educating our elementary students using 20% less funding than the rest of the district schools.

In addition, we haven't received any of the local enhancement mileage funds, even though our students are included in the count that determines TSP's share.

What these numbers mean is that TSP spends nearly twice as much on the education of the elementary students than the other elementary schools.

We initially asked an equitable amount per student, including the mileage amount, but in August revised our request to a simple management fee of 5%, plus receiving any additional state or federal funding we may qualify for.

I realize that access to some of the additional funds, like the enhancement mileage, will require finite scrutiny, but we believe that with recent updates, we have the necessary safeguards in place for everyone's peace of mind and the success of our schools.

Thank you.

[inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] I don't know if I can see this.

Hello Public Schools of potassium school board.

My name is Charlie and I learned that you are trying to take potassium monoxide out of the public school system.

[inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] Thank you very much.

[inaudible] [inaudible] There's one thing I would like to ask.

Would you please come to our school and let us learn from this part of the day.

Watch what we do.

Thank you for letting me share my opinion.

[inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [applause] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] Thank you very much.

[inaudible] I also did a stint working at the school and I was an interim administrator and I had the privilege of working with John Jeffery and James Bailey and Steve Nadel at that time who were all very helpful and sorry.

I was thinking about all these great people who we all wanted to have fun.

[inaudible] I remember being at a high school event and talking to Lou in the audience and it was the awards ceremony and statistically we were like, look at how many Montessori kids are up there on the stage.

So we know what it provides for the kids.

This Christmas we had everybody together and the kids were all talking about that and we were talking about relations with friends and peers and how they really learned how to work.

And I would say that about my kids.

The initiative that they have, they learn Montessori and that structure.

And as a parent, we were really seeking an alternative to traditional schools and Montessori for all those, that was the first year we became part of the public schools and we were so and are so grateful for that opportunity.

And as a parent, I appreciated the uninterrupted work cycle, the concentration periods, the freedom of movement.

And I know some of the things that you're here to teach people explain, but it was so powerful and our kids all speak so highly of their experience and what that turned and what that came to them.

And so, if this meeting tonight is about any decisions, I really ask that you table that and that you get some more information.

And I'm sure there's a lot of old guard here.

I think there's lots of people who would be happy to speak with you and help navigate and walk through that.

And I think it would be really good to lose this kind of options because options are great because it doesn't fit all families.

And it's really served the need and it's a 50 year old organization that's starting with.

Then Daniel.

My son will be in the morning at Montessori elementary in September.

As a parent and a physician who cares for children in our Northern Michigan community, I am saddened to see our district moving backwards and embracing education opportunities for all our children's needs and gifts, providing a variety of teaching styles and learning environments benefits everybody.

I strongly oppose the decision not to remove the management agreement with Montessori elementary school.

Please reopen negotiations.

Hannah.

My name is Hannah Vannos and I live at 1625 Abbey Road, and here is a community member diverse educational opportunities available to public school.

I'm a student at the top unique in northern.

The robust public school system, including the Montessori elementary is one of the main reasons we chose to move to the top.

The Montessori is a high performing school with student proficiency well above the state average, according to annual education report.

The Montessori scores even index score of 95.

5, of course, as a small school, each individual pupil at the Montessori will have more weight and the total metric compared to a larger school.

So some years may have fluctuations in scores, but overall performance is in line with the other elementary schools and capacity on the PSP letterhead for the meeting agenda tonight, the model chosen with every opportunity.

We are discussing your decision to remove an opportunity for public school students, a decision that was seemingly made with no public input and no public discussion, leaving parents, students, the teacher and community members blindsided.

The community does not want to lose this resource for our bright young people as a voter and to toss the resident.

I'm frustrated sad and mostly disappointed in the way this decision was made and disappointed that we could lose this resource.

The community wants to negotiate the community wants negotiation to happen.

We want to make sure that we have access to every opportunity.

Please make the bold choice to reopen negotiations.

Hi, my name is Jennifer Buchanan, I'm a fantastic resident I live at seven dirty Lockwood Avenue, and I'm a concerned citizen, my son Simon is here with me tonight.

He attended to ask him on the story Children's House from the age of five months through the fifth grade served on the board of trustees at Montessori for six years.

Over the last week I've done my best to understand the who, how, and why behind the public schools intentions to withdraw support in elementary school.

Sadly, it remains a mystery to me.

Is it test scores, is it the facilities, simply a breakdown in communication is absolutely clear to me is the task and Montessori Children's House and the public schools must find a path forward together.

I have seen solutions and yes they might take looking back in order to move forward.

I would like to move forward with a shared goal supporting this critical educational option within our community.

Why will not all children as you've heard, reach their full potential within a traditional classroom.

I will never know, but what I do know is that he thrived at the task and Montessori Children's House, and specifically in Russell carpenters classroom.

I am grateful.

He had that option to attend the school justice, I am grateful for the education he has received through the task he middle and high schools, his combined education built upon his Montessori foundation is evidenced by his academic success and personal growth.

He's a National Merit Scholarship finalist captain of the high school robotics team quiz bowl champion mentor, the middle and elementary school robotics teams and recognize leader, high school bands sustainability club student leadership and most importantly, he's a kind caring people young adult.

I ask that you revisit the agreement between the public schools and Montessori to determine what makes most sense for all and above all else, truly consider what our community will lose if this educational option becomes inaccessible for families, or is lost altogether.

Thank you.

Oh, you're gonna make me follow her.

Thanks.

Okay.

My name is also have a junior high school.

I am speaking today, both as a parent of a student at the high school, but also one who served on the board of the Montessori for four years, and actually on the president for three of those years, and I'm sorry for those years, and I truly understand the bloods button tears that have gone into the school and the passion that is here with to understand that there is much to be gained from the monetary education and appreciate that this has been an option.

I do understand the concerns.

I understand that there may be a lot of people that come up in the board meeting.

I'm discouraged from coming to public school.

I'm curious to know that you guys are here.

I never understood why she never came and stood up and gave a principal's report, because I'm like, if you are, we have students who are part of the public schools of the past.

Why aren't you coming and giving an administrator report as students of the public schools of the past, like everyone in that room should be also receiving that same report.

I'm curious to know if there has ever been any discussion that the public school part of the Montessori schools, go back under the actual public school so that the board that is in place at the Montessori school will be responsible for the ICO and the primary room up to kindergarten, and then from kindergarten through Russell's elementary room, but that would be considered another elementary school.

Because what we're hearing is that we're looking for a hybrid approach that isn't necessarily a hybrid.

So, I know, really quickly.

I really quickly also want to say that I need to say, there was some very difficult betrayal, I heard from other people within the Montessori community that put posters out that had unflattering circular images of the faculty and I just know that people within the Montessori school system know to do better.

And those images were very unflattering and disappointing.

Thank you.

Good morning, members of the board.

Simon Gelb, I live at 730 Lockwood Avenue, and I'm a current student at high school.

I thought it was seven months, but I guess it was five months through the grade.

I'm here today, not to speak to current or past administration of Montessori, or current test scores of its students, I can only speak to the educational opportunities I had there, which I cannot emphasize enough as being invaluable to my development.

I would say naturally, I'm not a very good student.

I struggle to pay attention, I'm stubborn about what I learned about, and often just do what I want to do.

Montessori gave me the environment I needed to learn what I wanted at my own pace and also to learn how to compromise and accept a more traditional learning.

I sincerely believe that if I had not attended Montessori, I would not be the person I am today, for the worse.

I owe my love of learning to Russ and the project-based learning and self-guided curriculum I would not have had elsewhere.

I was encouraged to learn about topics that both interested me and benefited my future.

I had a solid understanding of subatomic particles and had most of the periodic table memorized by third grade.

When I was reluctant to complete work or pay attention to lessons, I received the one-on-one support I needed and always found my way back on track.

I understand the financial realities of this situation, but would do all but insist that the district work with Montessori on resolving this issue rather than abandoning them completely.

Many students cannot succeed elsewhere, as was the case with many of my peers.

Denying them the ability to attend an elementary school where they can actually learn and focus without tuition is unacceptable.

I will admit these words I'm speaking now are unrehearsed and were only written around an hour ago now, hour and fifteen, because ever since I found out I've been at the high school robotics shop working.

I can guarantee that I would not be here or be able to say that if Montessori hadn't ignited the desire for learning and growth that I carry to this day.

This isn't about money and it isn't about test scores.

This is about children discovering who they are and being given the ability to thrive and grow into intelligent, kind, and creative people that can make our world a better place.

Thank you.

Hello, I'm Ariana Maldonado, 1033 Howard Street.

On behalf of all former students of Montessori, I ask that you hear the voices of proud Montessori graduates such as myself, and keep our words in mind when making the decision whether or not to shut down Patosky Montessori.

My school has contributed so much, not only to my education, but also to who I am as a person.

Russell was the best teacher I've ever had.

He treated each kid with kindness and saw the uniqueness and potential within each student.

Montessori not only paves the way for students to excel in life, but also lets them be the ones who build the road, deciding where they want to go.

Montessori and Russell make sure students are heard and given the chance to be themselves.

Montessori was also very supportive of me and my fellow classmates Native American culture.

They always made us feel seen and heard within our community.

I found there could be little to no trouble in the transition from Patosky Montessori to Patosky Middle School and Patosky High School.

Despite the different atmospheres, Montessori and Russell gave me the skills to succeed in any environment.

Being a student at Montessori does not hinder its graduating students.

In fact, I believe it gives them a head start in the chance to thrive.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Sarah Mann?

Hi, I'm Sarah Mann, 224 Ann Street.

I think most of what I would have said is already been covered.

But what I will say is that our family moved to this community 19 years ago.

I was six months pregnant.

And the reason we chose Patosky out of the areas we were looking at was the public Montessori school.

And all three of our programs went there.

My oldest has recently in college been diagnosed on the autistic spectrum.

We didn't know because he was in an environment where that didn't really matter.

But some of my understanding is that there's issues with giving students that might need extra accommodations.

The services they need.

My son had both speech therapy and he traveled to another elementary school for a time to work with Amy McMullen for a meeting.

It worked out fine.

We were able to negotiate and figure things out between the students.

And I just feel like taking an opportunity away from the youth in our community instead of looking for a way to move forward and keep it available is wrong.

Thank you.

My list.

Does anybody want to add to my list?

I want to bring.

Thank you for allowing us to speak here.

I'm a former Montessori parent.

My son is a junior at Patosky High School.

And I, like many of these parents that have spoken out, can reflect upon the legacy and the history and the relationships of Patosky Montessori Children's House to our community.

I'm reflecting back on the class that I graduated with.

I had the privilege of graduating in 1992 with Rainy Allen, whose mom, Terri Allen, founded the Patosky Montessori Children's House.

Right now we're experiencing a child care crisis.

So early childhood education is very important.

I know the focus tonight is on the elementary portion and the contract with the Patosky Montessori Children's House came through fifth grade.

But I must, I would be remiss if I didn't mention the opportunities for access to child care that exists as part of a continuum of education.

What were to happen to the Patosky Montessori Children's House if the contract with Patosky Public Schools was terminated, that could have a ripple effect on the early childhood education.

So in our context, both Hiram's father and myself were able to be working class laborers proletariat, and we were able to afford daycare because of a subsidy that my child qualified for as a member of the Native Sovereign Nation here of the Little Trevor So, access, diversity, equity, inclusion and access isn't a policy.

It's a policy but it also should be an action item.

So reflecting upon that Montessori and the early childhood education provided access for us so that we as working parents could afford to work and send our child to daycare.

So that was very instrumental in Hiram's formation.

We participated in the Montessori program through fourth grade and then we made a choice as parents to move over to Central Elementary School, and then on to the middle school and now on to the high school.

As a public and elected official, I have to believe that maybe it's because you have a 25 year contract.

You think back to when 25 years ago was it was 1999.

Things change rapidly and I know that in public service.

We're no longer recommended to sign 10 year contracts you usually are operating in terms of like maybe five or 10 year contracts, but 25 years.

Clearly, that contract isn't serving either one of you very well and it's totally legitimate and it could be a win win for the city to renegotiate a contract between the two entities at the privilege of opportunity of being in Traverse City today working with the 10 county regional organics group trying to get composting and recycling spread equitably about 10 counties and I talked to parents in the Traverse City T-CAP system.

They have a model Montessori contract within the T-CAP public service.

I'd like to mention that, you know, contract should be binding and it's okay to have a short plaza.

Andrew badinger.

Thank you.

I'm here to speak in support of the relationship between the potassium Montessori children's house and the public schools of the past.

One concern is the enrollment process at the capacity Montessori elementary school Montessori offers a different philosophy and approach to learning, and as such we realized that not all children are going to be successful in the program just as not all children are successful to their highest potential in the traditional setting.

In order to meet the children's interest the high school offers college prep, as well as other diverse programs such as culinary arts woodshop building trades and auto shop.

Similarly Montessori offers a different style of learning for children who may benefit from a varied approach.

When a child who is new to Montessori inquires about enrolling at the school, our process includes a tour as well as one to two meetings between the family and the guide to ensure everyone is clear on the philosophy and the expectations of the student, the family, and the gun.

This process is laid out in the district's annual education report, which is available at the public schools of the tosky website.

Each annual education report includes the process of assigning pupils to the school, which is as follows.

Pupils are assigned to the school based upon age and grade of the student living proximity to the school, whenever possible, class size siblings within the public schools of the tosky parental preference whenever possible, and the availability of the staff to meet the needs of the students.

Building principles together, decide the best placement based upon this criteria.

Our enrollment process meets the criteria laid out in the public schools of the tosky annual education report.

Montessori, like all the other district schools enroll students who need additional support in the past when we have students who have needed the support services we have transported the students to one of the other district elementary schools for set services and then transport them back to the tosky Montessori.

We welcome the opportunity to make adjustments to either the enrollment or student support system processes to better suit the public school to the tosky needs.

I'm Aaron bait enter at 3035.

I'm here in support of the partnership between the public school of the past, and the potassium Montessori children's house.

I would like you to consider what a huge draw the potassium Montessori children's house is for our school district.

We all know that education is not a one size fits all situation.

And I believe each, each child is unique and deserves to learn in a way that best suits their individuality Montessori is not a new idea, but is gaining popularity as parents are learning that their children are far more capable of growth.

And that is being placed in an ideal environment for them.

The public school enrollment numbers are dropping the nationwide.

And I feel it was a huge drop for our district by offering both traditional style, as well as alternative style, such as Montessori.

Montessori school can be a beacon for for the families looking for more diverse options in education, choosing the right path for my child education is one of the biggest concerns for me.

After visiting the Potosky Montessori children's house.

I knew without a doubt that this is where my child and children.

This is the most peaceful classroom setting I had ever experienced.

I was initially impressed by the polite behavior of the young children in primary.

And then the common focus to enter.

I witnessed in the elementary classroom.

I visit the elementary classroom, often now, and love to see the students demonstrate their natural curiosity, as they're allowed to access all the beautiful educational tools available in the room.

Mr Russell Carpenter is often sitting on the floor with the students fully engaged and meeting on their level.

Students in this setting are allowed to blossom far beyond what is expected of them in the traditional classroom setting.

The communal learning environment encourages collaboration and diffuses competitive competitiveness among peers.

These students develop strong independence and empathy, as well as a life long love for learning.

Yes.

It's simply mind blowing that the public schools of the past year willing to let this type of learning environment go.

Kelly.

We moved back here to near the.

Grand Rapids for 10 years.

Grand Rapids Public School has three public Montessori schools as part of their district.

They're thriving, they just built a new school.

Maybe longer.

Anyway, I lose track.

Um, I said I'd like to discuss the monastery curriculum, a little bit but we have three kids.

They are two boys went to the Grand Rapids Montessori, we had one finish up his two years with Russell.

He loved it.

We have a daughter in the kindergarten.

We hope to get her there.

We are a supportive and joyful learning environment that increases achievement for all students.

It supports a child's natural development to create capable but hard to do this, who become productive fulfilled adults lifelong learners as we see a high schooler thriving freshmen and a sixth grade student who's also driving.

The Montessori elementary school is an association of Montessori international which is am I accredited school.

We are one of three accredited programs in the state, and the only one in northern Michigan.

As you can imagine by the small number of schools in the state with the credential earning and maintaining am I.

This is not a minor feat.

In order to be am I certified you must have an in person evaluation every three years.

We are going to follow a high fidelity Montessori curriculum, maintaining the am I certification is a requirement under the current management agreement.

We completed the review completed the reevaluation process last May, and our accreditation accreditation was renewed.

Our nationally trained evaluator made the following statements about her experience at PMC ch Russell has a very strong sense of the curriculum, and was open to new ideas.

He was easy to talk to, and eager to learn ways to make this program, even stronger.

And I was impressed by the touches of appreciation for culture, diversity, and not a sorry.

My son read this without.

It's embarrassing I had to look it up.

I'm skipping it around the school, for example, there was a Jamaican flag displayed with the American flag outside the school building, a decision made by the elementary children to honor the home country of the classroom assistant.

Tomorrow, I appreciate the autonomy of the students have over their school building to show support for their areas of interest and passion.

Of note this year alone, nearly 50% of our enrolled PSP students came from out of district, as we've seen, we believe, if our program is embraced by PSP, the school could flourish and continue to grow the district as the beacon that it has been for our small community for many.

Everyone is a great 11th.

I think, as a child.

I'm encouraging you to continue writing and giving you today at school adults.

I'm so proud of every student.

And it would be really sad for all these kids that I'm a little trouble.

One more.

Emily.

I'm really happy to hear that today.

I'm going to speak to the condition.

And while I will admit that the field I learned a lot of worry, a lot of to talk about frequently and my personal life.

And my professional life.

And I would hate to see this opportunity to be taken away from the community.

The members of the Montessori community are problem solvers.

And I ask that you consider your decision so that you would be able to cover the conversation or teach the Montessori school available for future students.

[INAUDIBLE] Thank you.

I promise I won't cry.

No, you're sorry.

So I want to speak on just being the youth services director.

So I'll just say my name again and take it to the people.

Tina Dominic, youth services director here at the side.

And I read my daughter's letter earlier.

So I want to read the letter that I sent in on behalf of Little River Living Services and as a parent of Montessori students.

Dear Classy Public School Board, I'm writing to you as a parent and as a student in front of the youth center in support of the Classy Medical Children's Health.

My daughter, Carly Exely, transferred from Lincoln Elementary.

I'm just going to go to this part.

I want to talk about-- because we were talking about-- I was really concerned about-- I heard about test scores and that they're not performing.

It's like every student that I know, tribal or non-tribal, has been just super successful, not only academically, but with the community, community engagement.

We've heard story after story.

I think you guys could have had it.

I just want to talk to Carly.

It's not fair to her when I only talked about how she struggled.

But I want to talk about her success after she graduated from fifth grade from MSL.

I just want to do-- her success to tribal students.

We heard other stories.

And I hope you guys write letters-- or email-- children letters to the board for two days for a tribal student.

The instruction from Mr.

Carpenter and Mama Story and Montessori Supportive Learning Environment gave Carly a well-rounded academic foundation that has proven very successful.

Upon transferring to Cal State Middle School in sixth grade, Carly received many awards, additional Science Awards, a few other awards, she's been theater, she's been a multi-pistol in addition to the tribal sponsor, Canada Basketball, and the [INAUDIBLE] Outside of that, she works at [INAUDIBLE] and here at the [INAUDIBLE] Carly was confident to become a community organization, including Voices of Our Borders International Youth Choir, where she traveled over to Europe.

She danced and sang in Scotland and Dublin.

She performed in the Interlochen Center for the Arts Youth Pro, as well as Native American dancing for the Children of the World of Hermann.

She did an opening act for that tour.

She was not dancing, but just performing and students in children from around the world, really just social skills.

As a senior this year, Carly maintains all aid.

She works a part-time job, and she participates in our school's e-sport team and plays controller and family classes with money.

And she's excited to attend college this fall to further her education.

The culturally inclusive and supportive environment at Cal State Montessori is an invaluable opportunity for local tribal students and the greater community.

As an advocate for tribal youth and safe on the environment for indigenous students, I greatly encourage PSB to reconsider removing Cal State Montessori Children's House and the public school option.

Thank you.

Thank you, everybody who's getting their heartfelt comments.

Anybody else like to give comments here before we start to rest for the remainder of the meeting?

One, two, three, here we go.

Thank you, everybody.

All right.

Now we are on to recognition.

And now I'm going to tell you Dr.

Lozano.

Well, I got an addition.

Oh.

Yeah.

This time of year, we have to stretch out a lot of the longer lives.

That's some of our staff members who made a huge difference in our school and with our students.

So I've got-- just on my left, Brent, he was the coordinator of non-instructional services there at the high school.

So Brent, I don't have a line.

[INAUDIBLE] Zach Yonker, high school social studies teacher, long time here at the district, and soccer coach, executive assistant.

He got to sit in on his class AP Wecon for a couple months ago, put on the t-shirt, and just really knows his stuff and gets the prison over.

Diane Munson, the counseling secretary.

So how do you fill those shoes?

Yeah.

So sat down with Diane.

We just laughed.

We just said, OK.

We talked about when we post these things.

So I think typically, with the teaching positions, we'll wait till after spring break.

Diane, we might do that early.

Because I think there's a tradition like that.

We might be able to get some international candidates.

I want somebody to pitch Diane's writing for as long as possible.

And that's going to start to go down a little bit.

Diane's just amazing.

Paige Shepherd, she's a high school social studies teacher.

So she's not a retirement, she's a residency.

So she moved back to North Carolina.

And so Jake Lee has been filling in all year long.

So Jake Lee is going to continue to fill in all year long.

And he can host AP government, whatever else is involved with.

And then hot off the presses, Ms.

Lynn Loeske.

So she does get her letter back.

Was it yesterday?

Yeah.

OK.

I got to get back to Lynn.

I got to respond back.

I was like, oh.

So Lynn is just an out-of-counter in the high school English department.

I don't know if the OP award-- I don't know if that's public knowledge.

If I'm making it public knowledge, you know.

[LAUGHTER] So she's the OP award for AP.

[APPLAUSE] So that's kind of our list right now.

I might have a different list coming up next month.

There's a retirement incentive for the teachers.

They just have to submit their retirement resignation by March 1.

So those are the ones that we have so far.

So there's a lot of institutional knowledge that is going to be possible to be put.

[INAUDIBLE] Yes.

That's what we're doing.

All right.

So we have to go directly to this.

Down memory lane here.

So, beginning January 18th.

We have our special meeting on January 22nd.

I closed the meeting.

[INAUDIBLE] So I recommend with the board [INAUDIBLE] I'll make a motion that the recommended C of D has to be approved as reported.

[INAUDIBLE] Moved by Trustee Attee, supported by Trustee Pataki.

All those in favor say aye.

Aye.

Any opposed?

Motion carries.

Dr.

Leslie on to warrants.

Bill Milchin spent $3,486,021.

13 today.

So I recommend that you pay the bills.

So if she has to look at those and be in touch with Bill with any questions, concerns?

You got that down now, right?

Oh, yes.

Right down to the 13 cents.

13 cents.

In some sense.

[INAUDIBLE] Moved by Trustee Pataki, supported by Trustee Flynn.

All those in favor say aye.

Aye.

Any opposed?

Motion carries.

On to the resolution of Therapy Dog Sock Electric.

I feel like this Groundhog Day is over.

Oh, I don't know.

I think you guys are positive.

Yeah, I'm waiting for Bill Murray to wake up to Sonny and Sarah with a Therapy Dog.

So you guys have a little bit of a-- Well, we do.

So we took a proposal to do therapy last night, and we had a great conversation.

Basically what we did was we did meditation, we did feedback.

Sometimes we incorporate that into our conversation.

We did feedback on therapy.

We had a wonderful conversation on the questions we had last time.

[INAUDIBLE] So tonight we'll go to the questions that the board proposed or asked us, and that we discussed last night at our district TLC meeting.

And I'm not going to go through the whole presentation.

Not the whole presentation.

But just the questions and answers that came up with the help of the district.

The first question that we had from the board was whether it be a policy given to applicants.

All right.

So there we are.

The first question that we were asked by the board was, I'd like to think you could allow the purchase of a gold retriever to add to the parameters.

So we wrote this proposal.

The trainer of the therapy docs, who works down on the state, has recommended Labradoodles, or doodles I should say, or golden retrievers.

And that's what he trains for the majority of our schools, or schools in Michigan.

So at this point in the district, TLC thought that it would be probably best to say that those two would be recommended grades, just to give back what he has most experienced with.

I thought that could change in time, but right now he's thought for watching the program, and I think that maybe this is the recommendation of the trainer.

Another question that was asked is who would be covering the annual training cost.

And so we would lose the tough to talk to the act funds, which would be fund rates or grants at the right, to cover that cost of having someone come up and make sure that all of our staff can work with the animals as they go.

And then another question of whether the school district is working here and wants to take the job with them, which we understand, however, there's a 5,000 put into the training, that the person gets for free because it's been funded by grants to the school, with their financial claw back from the teacher, or on their own duty within a certain time frame.

So as we discussed last night, the cost of transferring the dog to another post family, and allowing the owner to buy back the dog at the end of the service, or the community would allow the owner to pay back the training cost to the tax funds, and buy back the dog from the district.

So this would be determined kind of by a case by case scenario.

Another question was, if there's a dog that shows aggression or just is not a good fit, what would be the guidelines for removing the dog?

The TLP determined that the trainer and the local veterinarian would be making those accommodations.

When we have the trainer come up annually, we would be able to say that that person was checking on all of our parent dogs and making sure they were still able to pick the dogs.

And if a dog is not in shape to be in that position, they would be removed from that job.

The other thing we talked about was can you get more firm numbers on the vet insurance.

So right now it's hard to get a firm answer on that, because every dog is different.

People depends on age, depends on health, depends on a lot of different factors.

So the insurance could vary between 1,500, 1,500 depending on the breed and the general health of the dog.

And we just talked about the importance of the TLC, that they can provide that insurance for all of the other dogs, just so every dog receives adequate care, regardless of the host family's financial situation.

So we would like to provide that as a option.

That's an annual number, correct?

Yes.

The next question that we addressed was if there are several applications for dogs at the same time in the same building, would the Board of ATB be involved in that decision?

And it was talked about last night that we would have the Drug Committee make those decisions and the Administrator in that program.

And then, so will there be a policy given to applicants?

We have a plastic act therapy dog proposal that comes with a plastic act therapy dog policy if it is approved by the school board tonight.

So we'll take that proposal and turn it into a policy.

We'll say no.

Correct.

Okay.

And then just know that the committee would continue to meet as needed throughout the year and at least annually if there were no other ways to do that.

So that's how it's working and if there are any adjustments that are necessary.

So those are the questions.

If there are any further questions, or maybe just remind me again who is on the therapy dog committee.

There are school board members, administrators, and then the committee members.

I think we need to meet what we would do though if this is approved.

[inaudible] Can we just get back to the financial piece?

What is this?

Do you want to go back to this part?

Sure.

So, potocky tax funds would be money that is fund-raised or donated on behalf of therapy dogs to the district.

So it would be one spot where that money would go and then be distributed as needed from the different organizations that have that sort of stuff.

And we put in here the difference that might come out of that fund.

And then the next column is the district responsibility.

We put that insurance.

We didn't want it to become an issue where a family, a host family would have to make a decision about if there's a financial problem within their family.

So we thought having the district be responsible for making sure that they're responsible for the food from the building.

And then the liability insurance that's a part of all of that.

And then the host responsibility.

So I'm a host of talking to the dog at the high school and the host would be responsible for the dog, the cost of the dog.

Food, home supplies, toys, anything that you would do at home would be both.

And then the deductible of the insurance and 10 percent of what the family that we have would have to be.

So estimated total there.

And then grooming is just one thing that you kind of talked about.

But that I think will end up being a problem.

I'm for the dog to, I don't know that unless I have big issues with my dog.

I don't know that it's not a thousand dollars after that.

That seems like a lot to me.

Oh my gosh.

Yeah, but not on an annual consistent basis.

I think the peace of mind that knowing that that dog is a good thing that I didn't have a second guess should I take the dog in.

That's what insurance is for.

That's the peace of mind for me that has been really nice and stressful.

Do we need to do these tests?

Yes, we need to do these tests with this dog.

We have to live forever.

So that's kind of the approach that I think that I got.

And so right now with what your proposal is, we're talking a dog for every building.

Every building?

If the building is a house.

If the building was.

That would be next.

We're not looking at it.

Would that be four, five, six?

Yeah.

Okay.

Is there any other questions?

Sorry, that was just thanks for my question.

Not at all.

Sorry.

I just don't remember if the insurance covered vaccinations for the dog.

Well, with all of it.

Thank you.

Thank you so much.

Thank you.

Thank you guys for answering your questions.

[inaudible] Thank you guys for doing that.

That was good information.

[inaudible] Will we follow the protocol?

[inaudible] [inaudible] So yeah, I mean, we've talked about this.

I think that, I mean, they're reducing a lot, you know, paying a lot of their funds out of donations, which I think is wonderful.

We know that the dogs seem to make a big difference in helping kids in regulation and everything else.

[inaudible] So on this resolution, while I love that we have a resolution for central directory, it doesn't necessarily state anything about what we're going to do for the remaining buildings.

I mean, are we, we're saying we're going to do this, allow it to happen for all buildings, aren't we?

[inaudible] [inaudible] All right.

Moved by trustee, a T supported by trustee.

All those in favor say aye.

Any opposed?

Motion carries.

[inaudible] These tables are put in there 30 some years, so they're all [inaudible] So I'm assuming with these different numbers, this is a comparable and people are using these.

They're comparable tables and three bids were analyzed by the service director.

Any questions about the cafeteria table?

Moved by trustee, supported by trustee.

All those in favor say aye.

Any opposed?

Motion carries.

All right.

Moving on to Dr.

Leslie and the resolution for the general fund budget revision number two.

Things aren't as bad as they used to be.

[inaudible] You'll see on your document that we have three columns, the original budget, the budget revision number one that you approved in either November or December, and then what we're presenting this evening.

The variance from the most recent approved budget revision number one to the proposed budget revision number two, we have $835,040 more in projected revenue.

And on the expense side, we have $162,587 reduction in overall expenditures.

With those changes, it brings our budget revision number one projected $1.

15 million deficit.

This is a deficit of only $160,000 that then would leave our fund balance at just over slightly more than 23% at the end of this 23-24 school year.

Are you answering questions?

Yeah, absolutely.

Well, our biggest one number in that one that appears in this expenses is this instructional added means.

Was there a big thing that changed within that or what?

A lot of grant stuff that's been added.

You'll see a lot of categorical funding that we'll talk about in the PowerPoint and a lot of categorical funds falling into the -- oh, that's a decrease.

Yeah, that's a decrease.

So the decrease is -- that big decrease is because the budget revision number one had all aids as PSP employees for the entire year.

We did not switch them to PSP employees until halfway through the year.

So most of that reduction is the savings in PSP employees versus edu-staff employees for the first time.

There we go.

Sorry, Bill, do you want to go through your slides?

Because I think that's going to -- Bill's got a little presentation that I think is going to be helpful.

Okay.

All right, perfect.

I just thought that was just a big little -- and Bill told me this earlier today, his PowerPoint skills have really come along.

We're evaluating him on growth.

Oh, that's why we're meeting next week.

Anyway, we'll go through revenues first and the changes in revenues.

Local revenues, we have an increase of $1.

7 million.

The biggest increase there being $1.

6 million is in local property taxes.

That's good news, except there's a side to that which whatever we receive more there, we receive less from the state.

The major is the increase of $155,000 investments.

We have -- we're earning more, still more on our investments than the original budget revision number one projected.

We're doing well in that athletic ticket sales, so $30,000 more there.

Full-bed sales increase of the $22,500.

That's auto tech and the house, the projected sale is a pulse at the end of the year.

The budget revision decreasing $49,250, not quite as high as Roman as we thought and more on the sliding scale of three.

State revenues, a decrease of $1.

15 million.

State aid decrease of $1.

6 million makes up all of that plus sum because we're almost the exact same amount as an increase in local property taxes.

Categorical funding goes up to $175,409.

I put that in there because categoricals are just crazy this year.

Fifteen categoricals and we've got at least an owner of three or four chances to apply for more categorical grant funding.

So a lot of change is there.

New transportation categorical that we did put in the original budget revision number one is $292,346, how processed costs of transportation.

And new fast with categorical funding of $10,650, that's to encourage more kids to participate and fill out the fast budget.

On the federal revenue side, a decrease of $102,000.

That's Title I and there we're just matching revenues and the projected spend.

We're not going to spend all the Title I money until we reduce the revenue while we reduce the expenses.

Other revenues, an increase of $281,000.

There the bulk ed millage decrease of $126,000 and that is again the next revenue expenditure.

The big one increase here is special education funding from the ISD.

That 90% reimbursement each year are as much as possible, so our reimbursement percentage goes up.

And our enhancement millage decrease of a very small amount, $2,270.

So my question on that is transportation categorical, is that offset busing cost?

Yes.

Okay.

It was a long drawn out formula where they looked at ridership for square miles.

So the more rural you were, the more you might have gotten funding, of course, based on cost area.

And that sounds like it's going to be ongoing.

You know, when I was in Lansing yesterday, those conversations, I think they're going to be tweaking it because they looked at like riders per square mile, but then if you've got a lake in the middle of your district, that's going to have an impact.

So then they look at riders per linear mile, so they're going to keep tweaking that, but there's going to be that funding that's going to be going on.

It's going to continue next year.

That's coming out of the Lacon County looked at, Lacon and Oakland put together that, you know, the school equity funding proposal that they really looked at across.

You know, this is part of that, more looking at how different funded it is compared to everybody in the state funding.

This was a situation where the state legislature and the governor will tell them, yes, we want X millions of dollars to be doled out for transportation.

And then MBE goes, we don't have to do that.

So then they task it to one of the ISD.

So it's like McComb, you know, Wayne Reese.

I mean, some of the bigger ones, they're the ones that really do.

You know, does McComb ISD know about rural school districts?

They might have stayed at a Holiday Inn Express.

I don't know.

But they're the ones that are doing it.

And they're not, you know, and they know they're going to get it right.

It takes a while to get this stuff out.

I mean, when we were working on our budget last year, we had no idea that we were going to get over $292,000 in transportation.

We didn't know such a thing existed.

And when we did budget revision number one, we knew it was coming.

But I still had no idea of knowing how much.

So I just left it out.

Well, the other thing I just want to make sure you all see is that special ed funding for the ISD, that increase of $405,000, just $406,000.

You know, special ed is two contenders.

I'm going to talk about that special ed move that's coming up in May.

You know, and what that allows us to do is hire every special ed teacher I can possibly find.

And that's kind of what we were doing.

Because we're going to get 90% reimbursement on that money a year later.

That special education millage for our district is $2224, which is $1.

9 million overall.

So it was $125,000 or $126,000, and then it went up $400,000.

So, I mean, if that millage doesn't pass, that's a really, really, really bad day.

But because if we get 90% reimbursement on our costs, you know -- [ Inaudible ] Oh, my God, yeah.

[ Inaudible ] Generally teachers, special ed teachers, the kids, everybody.

May 7th is -- whatever that election day is in May.

It seems like it's early May, but, I mean, we want to get that word out now because so many people vote absentee.

So that's kind of what that big question is.

We probably get our absentee ballots by election March.

Sometimes I'm guessing if that election is early May.

Can I ask you -- Yes.

Can you repeat what you said here about the preschool tuition?

Preschool tuition decrease for two reasons.

One, not as many enrollees is what I had originally planned for.

And then the mix between full pay and free based on the sliding scale of home income is, you know, for social economic impact.

Those two things.

Thank you.

So this just gives you a bar chart view of the free budget and then the five different categories, local, intermediate, state, federal and other revenue.

And really I won't go through any of the numbers, but you can see that they're all very close except local went up considerably because of local property taxes.

State dropped considerably because of the offset to that.

The rest of it's really fairly constant, consistent from original budget to first revision to second revision.

And that's where we want to get to is where we're budgeting at the beginning.

Something that looks fairly similar to what we end up doing.

So revenues on a pie chart basis, where does our money come from?

I'll just concentrate on revision number two.

You can see 56% of that is coming from local, 29% from the state, 13% from other and then 1% from the federal.

And 1% from intermediate.

On the expenditure side, homes only went up 160,000.

There's no decrease of 160,000.

But here are the changes.

Increase in early retirement incentive costs.

I didn't really have those filled into.

The budget revision number one didn't know exactly for sure how many.

Now we're getting a little better feel for how many.

So we're starting to put those costs in.

What we talked about, those aid costs being full.

PSP employees and budget revision number one and then revision two there.

[Inaudible] Increase in tech department costs when the budget was developed.

Howard was just kind of getting started.

And so now we have a better feel for what it's going to take to run the tech department.

So we made those changes.

The revision number one did not do the student success list.

So that's now in there.

Special education staff that were added throughout the year.

So that's aid -- I mean a teacher and two aides.

We reduced workshop costs to match what I think we're going to do.

Increase in membership costs.

Increase in costs related to the district survey.

Originally I had put in what I had as an estimated amount.

It came in higher than that due to the sheer volume of surveys that are going out, that type of thing.

Tax abatements when people request for property tax value, they can't, sometimes they have to pay money back.

And then we recoup it from the state later, but we call that expense when we pay it back.

Telephone costs are going down.

Contract with garbage and refuse going up.

And a small increase in our contract is in the transportation contract.

So those are all built into this.

So again, these are the categories.

I won't go through all of them.

You can see very similar from one budget to the next to the next.

This is one that -- this gives it to us in different categories.

Those categories you just saw on the previous slide are the ones the state says we have to.

These probably make more sense to people.

Their wages, benefits, purchase services, supplies and other.

And I think it's -- if you look between the three pie charts from original to revision one to two, revision one wages and benefits, 76 percent of our costs.

Revision number one, 77 percent of our costs.

Number two, back to 76 percent of our costs.

Now that number as a total, a lot of times you'll hear districts say between 80 and 85 percent.

So we're on the low side of that.

But a good part of that is because our contracted purchase services, some of our employees are still paid through a third party so they're not wages.

They're contracted services.

That mainly is for part of the year with our aides and it's always our facility.

Substitute teachers is another question.

Yeah, that's a -- correct.

That's another one that's very good.

I will give you next time I present something on this.

I had a slide that somehow I didn't get to turn Lori to the right PowerPoint, but it had a breakout and enrollment between total resident and student school to choice.

So you could see -- oh, good.

The one you got in your packet -- okay.

So you heard in your packet anyway.

But if everyone were able to see that, you could see that resident student population is declining.

About at the same pace that this total is declining.

And the schools of choice is staying relatively flat.

They kind of started and then it bumped up a little in the middle years, and then in the last year it kind of went back down.

But it is between 475 and 530, I think is the largest number.

So 20 percent of our students approximately come from schools of choice.

And the last is the fund balance.

And again, we're on a good trajectory up.

It looks like we will flatten out this year.

And then we'll see where we go about future years based on negotiations, foundational knowledge increases, what happens with enrollment.

And that represents approximately 23 percent of extended students.

We're not going to have budget revision number three, right?

There might be a sign at the very end of the year.

We're hoping not.

If I'm close enough on this one, I will have it.

But if I'm not as close as I should be, then we'll have to have one more.

You don't have to as long as you're within a range on your expenditures.

Most districts do that.

My goal would be if we're good enough for 200 students, we'll ask them, but we'll see.

So that one's for me.

So we need to approve that general fund budget revision number two.

Any questions?

Make a motion to approve general fund budget revision number two as presented.

All in favor?

Moved by Trustee Attee, supported by Trustee Flynn.

All those in favor say aye.

Aye.

Any opposed?

Motion carries.

Dr.

Leslie.

We'll move on to the discussion of the Montessori agreement.

Do you have any chance to stand up?

Yeah, you can just say it, though.

Well, I'm going to show you Montessori.

This will be a good place for us to kind of kick off this discussion.

It's just going to be kind of like a little bit of a history lesson.

This is kind of my understanding.

So the Passover children's house established in 1973, I think that's pretty similar to what we heard tonight, where it's been in existence for 50 years.

The management agreement between Montessori and the Passover school began in 1997, 98.

So Lori was able to find that original motion.

I think that was pretty helpful when Dr.

Jaffa was here.

So what I was told was that was to help assist the Montessori school with their finances at that time.

And there were some other things that were in that motion from Dr.

Jaffa.

It's kind of that mission for both sides.

So it's an independent, private, non-profit corporation run by a board of directors that's separate from the public schools of Haskin.

It's not a charter school and it's not a public school academy.

So then the funding relationship since 2000 or earlier, I think this is important because I know some people had already mentioned it.

This had a big role in kind of our decision.

So I mean the one thing that I just want people to see is this spreadsheet has been going on since 2000, 2001.

So every year there's just another tab added at the bottom.

So this was kind of one of those random years that showed me when I first got superintendent here.

So it is kind of the same thing, the same format every year.

You know, and I've kind of taken one particular year like Raymond's last year.

That's going to be on these next slides.

Just so people kind of see all the business manager does is keep adding.

So it's that same thing every year.

And then I've got like the historical data, but that's just kind of enrollment and stuff.

And I've got a better way to show that.

So what I did here is I just kind of blew up.

This was the one that Brandon Wheeler did when I first became superintendent.

So a few things how how that revenue was determined.

So we've got two count days.

We've got one in February and then we've got one in October.

So yesterday was our February count day.

So typically what happens every school year is that February count day will be 10 percent.

And then the October count day and fall that's going to count as 90 percent.

There's been some years where they kind of messed with those percentages.

Kind of depends on who's running.

I think for the most part, the February count counts 10 percent.

The October count is 90 percent.

So the previous year you can kind of see there are 35 kids.

So that would be K through five.

So 10 percent of that is 3.

5.

And then the final of October is at 28.

So that counts 90 percent.

So we're going to count that as 28.

7.

So that year our foundation allotment was 9,150.

So you just take whatever your FTEs are times that amount and then you get that grand total.

So kind of one of the things that Bill was just talking about from the state financing standpoint, we'll get our local taxes here and then we retain them.

The state will determine how much our total FTE revenue should be and then the state will supplement that money to us.

And then if you're in a school district like Harvish Springs where your local amount is going to exceed what that foundation allotment is, then you're out of formula and the state doesn't send you anything additional.

And then this, you know, brand is last year.

There must have been some COVID money that was still available.

That helps with pre-equalization.

So there's part of that.

The one thing that I don't understand is like this non-resident student adjustment.

And we'll kind of talk about that a little bit, that $180.

But so then that's that total income.

So that $276,620.

So that's the total income that the public schools of Toscan receives for those 28.

7 students.

So then in terms of the appropriations in that management agreement.

So the public schools of Toscan will retain the cost of the teacher benefits, etc.

So you can kind of see salary, FISA, retirement, health insurance, etc.

The audit expense, $150, that was in the original contract, the original management agreement, I should say.

And then that 20 percent administration fee, that 20 percent revenue, that's been in that contract, that management agreement since 1997.

So the total expenses then is that $190,683.

So then the distribution to Montessori last school year then was just shy of $86,000.

So we will have our pound day, our total count day will be in early October.

So then the state will quickly calculate how much money we shouldn't get in that school year.

And then we get our first state aid payment then on October 20.

So we'll get a state aid payment every month except for September.

That's kind of one of the things that Bill mentioned in one of the presentations earlier, is we've got to have a fund balance so that we can pay the bills, we can pay everybody in the month of September so we don't get in.

So this format happens every year, kind of going back to at least 2000 in that spreadsheet.

And I'm sure it happened in '97, '98, but they probably didn't have that as well back then.

So then you kind of see that's how they get paid.

This is the one thing that didn't make any sense to me, especially coming from an out of formula district where I was in Buffalo.

So, you know, Harbor Springs has a higher foundation allotment, a lot of that at stake, so that $9,240.

I think what the argument is, is hey, you've got two kids coming from Harbor Springs, so that's an additional $90.

So I think the assumption is that we as a school district are getting more money because we're taking those kids from Harbor Springs.

You know, Harbor Springs isn't sending us a check, you know, for taking their kids.

Nobody's sending us a check.

It's just, you know, we've got whatever our enrollment is, wherever we get them from, and then that's the money that gets supplemented in the state.

So this is kind of how the enrollment has gone, you know, going back to 2000.

And then the PSB payment to Montessori, you know, the only thing that I just got correct is that very last thing.

So you kind of see where the enrollment was starting back to 2000.

You can kind of see for the most part in the 30s, I guess had a little dip there probably due to recession or something in 12-13.

Had a little, you know, probably jumped up a little bit during the pandemic and then it's kind of dropped down these last two years.

So for the blended count for last year was 20.

1.

I think right now I think they got 23 kids in their service.

And then, you know, part of that management agreement, so like I said, you know, we withhold the cost of the teachers with benefits and everything.

So when I was going back through those spreadsheets, like in 2000, 2001, 2001, 2002, according to that spreadsheet, they had two teachers.

So they had Russell and then they had another lady.

But then on that '02-'03 spreadsheet, there was just Russell.

And you kind of see there's that jump in the payment to Montessori.

So you kind of see their enrollment, you know, Russell must have been working hard then, you know, because that other teacher wasn't there anymore.

So you kind of follow along.

I mean, you see where there's a dip in enrollment, there's a dip in Montessori, et cetera.

Now, with the current agreement for this year, instead of withholding that 20 percent, the agreement that we came up with in August was that we would withhold five.

You know, so where that drops down to, that would have been like $28,000.

Okay.

And so that's kind of what that very last number is over there for that TFP payment to Montessori.

That's if it would have stayed at that 20 percent.

Okay, what we negotiated there in August was that it would be 5 percent.

So that $28,000 really wanted to be in about $58,000.

So kind of here's kind of our trip down memory lane, if anything I want to be as transparent as I possibly can.

So I met with Nikki Byron on April 13, you know, 2023, and she invited me over there to visit Montessori.

You know, Jenny T.

joined me on May 3rd, and did the same thing.

And so the one thing that Nikki presented to me was the Management Agreement Renewal Proposal.

So and this is kind of, you know, somebody alluded to this earlier, kind of where they wanted to change the terms and what had been going on.

So I just kind of, you know, a little snipping to it.

So here's the part of that that was changed.

So one is to start paying rent.

So the lease includes rent operating expenses based on the pro-rize share of the items.

So the rent would be projected to be $17,250 annually, and that's how they calculated that amount.

Facility management costs, so including pro-rize share of mortgage, insurance facility management costs.

So they anticipated for estimated maintenance and repairs of $10,000, and spent $3800, a mortgage of $9,500.

I was told that they don't have a mortgage on there now, they paid that off, and they paid the mortgage and the rent goes.

I don't know if this is what they had.

So the utilities are $3,000, and then contracted services are $8,500.

So staffing, so full-time teaching assistant for the elementary classroom, the existing management agreement says that the public school's task is we don't pay for any of this.

The only person who pays it is the teacher.

And the pro-rize share of salaries for the primary and administrative staff, so that's projected to be $80,000.

So they want to waive the management fees so that what happened, 20%, they want to be zero.

They wanted approximately $14,000 per pupil matching the $14,000 per pupil at the four elementary schools.

For this current year, we get from the state $9,608 per student.

So what they had in their proposal was that our projected increase would be under $150,000, which that's a chunk of change.

So right now, they've got 23 students, and we know what our revenue is right now.

So that's going to be more than what we're getting from the state.

So what I went through, and this is to kind of verify those numbers, so looking at what they have, so the next $17,000, some change, so the maintenance cost $34,800, staffing $8,000.

That $14,000 students, they got 23 students, so that's $322,000.

So that total is $454,000.

And then if I deduct the cost of the teacher, that $150, then that would be our shared Montessori school for this year would be $320,000.

So that's where we're at.

It's not where we're at, though.

And I know we're not supposed to interrupt, but you declined this offer.

Yeah.

So this is-- Excuse me.

Can I finish here?

Yeah.

So this, you know, some of the attorneys got that, you know, from the get-go.

So we shared the original management agreement with one of our attorneys, and he just went through.

I don't know the last time an attorney did review that.

If it happened.

You know, so he had like 32 concerns with issues.

So over the course of our negotiations, you know, last summer, we also reduced the management fee from 20% to 10%.

You know, and the response that we got, you know, through multiple, going back and forth throughout the summer, was that that was going to be insufficient to allow the Montessori school to remain financially viable.

So that was, you know, from their attorney.

So we talked about, you know, could they charter through some other entity other than us?

I mean, I thought that would really be the best solution.

You know, if we get to a point where we just can't come to an agreement, you know, like, you know, Concord to Toss.

Or if we're a chartered school through some other entity, you know, there's public charter schools out there, so it would remain a public school, but it's not as well.

Then we talked about doing a one-year addendum, you know, just to get us through the school year.

And that's kind of what we wound up doing.

We got to the point where it was August, you know, and so we had to figure out, okay, what are we going to do with Russell?

What are we going to do with those kids?

Can we come up with some kind of agreement just to get us through the school year?

So we went back and we took a look at this more attorney that we assigned to this.

You know, it wasn't like he communicated with their attorney 26 separate days, but when you looked at his bill from going with the original management agreement, his conversations, email exchanges with the attorney from the Montessori, he had 26 separate days, you know, and some of that included, you know, writing opinion letters to the board so that you could go into closed session and discuss these things.

So that happened twice, including that regular board meeting in August before he came out of closed session and voted on it.

So that gives you an idea of what his attorney's meeting was.

That 47th and 40th.

So then on the August 17th board meeting, that's when you all approved.

That was when it was in the test.

So, and this is, this was the amendment.

I mean, it's not much.

It's just, it's a page and a quarter.

There's not much to it.

In fact, it's September 1st.

You know, so it's one of the lines in here, you know, the parties desire such modifications to apply to academic year 23, 24, which is anticipated to be the final year of the management agreement.

You know, because that's kind of what we have in our head is this is going to be it, you know.

So, and as part of that, we reduced the, that management fee or however it's phrased in here from 20% down to 5%.

So, so I met with Nikki Byron on September 20th.

She signed the agreement on October 1st.

I signed it on October 23rd because it took a while for me to get it.

So, so this was kind of our email exchange between Nikki.

So she emailed me late on October 10th and just said, sorry to rehash this again, but our board meeting tonight, I heard some conflicting information about the status of the management.

Can you confirm that you have to renew the agreement passed the 23, 24 school year?

So at that time I hadn't seen the signed version of it.

And I just said, look, I don't believe we have them for the 23, 24 school year yet.

Is that still being hammered out between the attorneys?

And she responded, no, I signed it and sent it back to my attorney and we should get it soon.

I just want to clarify that we're still not planning to renew past the school year after this agreement is executed.

We're trying to get our ducks in a row and what I heard last night conflicted with what you stated when you met a couple weeks ago.

So, so yeah, that's correct.

Our plan is to end the agreement after the 23, 24 school year.

So, and then, so I signed it on the 23rd.

I didn't get it until that time because they didn't get their state aid agreement.

You know, so I didn't have an agreement.

So October 20th came and went and she was like, hey, we haven't gotten our money.

And I'm like, well, we don't have a contract.

So, so she sent me her signed contract.

I signed it on the 23rd and I was able to send it to Mon.

So she emailed Mark Ashley on the 25th and just said, I was notified by Dr.

Lesley that the district does not intend to renew the partnership after the school year.

I hope this is simply a misunderstanding as we're playing with the term degree that the school year would like to renew.

This is when things really went down.

So I think that the line where I hope this is simply a misunderstanding after all the negotiations that we went through over the course of the summer.

And it wasn't a misunderstanding.

You know, she knew what she signed.

So, you know, where I got frustrated is so that previous year, we sent him about 86,000 dollars.

And he said that was insufficient to allow Montessori school to remain financially viable.

So in their proposal, it was 150,000.

It might have been upwards of 320,000, just depending on how we were doing math, but we were never able to come to that agreement.

And so now they're like, well, hey, they're pleased with the 57 dollars.

So 86,000 was insufficient, but they're pleased with the 57.

So we met.

There's a number of my storyboard, Mark, Kathy, Bill, Becky and I.

So that was on the number 16.

We had a follow up meeting on June 30th that that would have been sooner.

But there was some sickness issues.

So these are some of the things that we talked about.

You know, in my mind, we were done after this year.

So I just sat there and listened to what conversation.

I just didn't see any path forward.

So we talked about the NWA test scores in relation to student support and intervention.

We talked about the enrollment process, because that was one of the things that we learned about that I don't think we really knew.

And I think our concern there was for a public school, you know, how do we say no to someone?

We talked about the curriculum resources.

We talked about professional development, special education services, student retention rates.

So these were just kind of ongoing conversations over those two days.

So and then so February 8th, you know, she emailed Mark and Kathy.

And so she said, you know, I'm following up on a meeting from last week to confirm this decision is based primarily on passing schools and determine the good.

For student performance proficiency, as well as our admissions process and challenges, student support services.

I realize there are other areas of concern as well, but these are the primary reasons for not recommending renewal.

In my mind, everything was fine.

Everything that we talked about back in August.

So here's what we talked about in summer 2023 finances.

It was their attorney's words.

Current funding was insufficient.

A lot of Montessori school and financial viable.

Did it need one hundred and fifty thousand?

What was it going to be?

Three hundred and twenty eight thousand.

We talked about chartering with other entities like ISD's.

Some from Michigan does like State University.

We never talked about student task.

We never talked about the enrollment process.

We never talked about the current.

None of those things.

I think you can kind of hear the frustration in my voice.

That's all we have talked about.

And this was this was a letter that no one said.

And I think these kind of things is going to make it very difficult.

So you can hold it.

I'm pretty sure the person who's working behind the scenes, you know, when I look at my.

So with the college, St.

Francis, this is just some.

You know, you don't have I mean, do you cost our administrators in a minor parking lot and tell them now?

Here we are.

So now I've got employees that are requesting a uniform please to be here.

The relationship.

And that's just kind of where I feel we are.

You know, I currently I don't see the path.

And the public exposure thing, the laws here, those hippies.

All right.

Well, difficult stuff.

Public schools.

He did not start a Montessori and we're not shutting it down.

We're not going to do that.

You know, we had this change this past year because Montessori board felt that they weren't getting sufficient funding.

And with the management agreement, a compromise couldn't be reached.

And so their their their spokesperson attorney said that the funding was not sufficient for them to continue.

And so that's what we came up with this one year to have them be able to find a different home.

It wasn't just cutting them off.

It's like, OK, let's give you time.

We're going to give you a little additional money and make sure how to do that.

So, you know, as I said, you know, it's a separate corporation free to choose as it did prior to our involvement.

They've been around longer than our involvement.

So, yeah, you know, it's this is just not something currently that's in our current business model that we choose to operate going forward.

So it's difficult.

I understand that the passion, you can hear that in all the letters that were provided, all of your stuff this evening.

So this is nothing against Montessori as a teaching practice and the experiences that people have.

But it is a financial decision that was made based on the board's recommendation of what they needed to move forward.

Oh, yeah, I, I, I clearly.

That's certainly Russell's performance has never been.

But, you know, one of the couple of people mentioned that.

Montessori is done in public schools.

They are not trying to interface with a separate corporation to try to do things which creates a lot of issues.

And that's something I think that Melanie alluded to.

Also, they're not accredited.

So a lot of the practices that.

So a lot of the things that.

So another thing that we're not.

And we control it and we use the Montessori.

So that's not it.

Very difficult to be confident that our students that are in the Montessori school.

And these are just theoretical.

Because Montessori uses a different approach where they have.

We don't do that.

We have our.

So Montessori.

So when you have a license.

And welfare of the children.

We'll have no sort of ability to affect how the licensure.

The state won't deal with us.

So those are concerns that we have.

We have certain responsibilities.

Thank you.

very misleading i can speak from the back corner elementary update so [ Background Sounds ] [ Background Sounds ] [ Background Sounds ] >> Okay, Mark.

>> Thank you.

Still visiting the elementaries.

Just finished up our winter assessments and data collection.

We are now looking at all the growth we've seen, also looking at using that data to move things forward, adjustment interventions, and also the extension groups who changed that model about a year ago.

So, meeting all the kids, kind of where they're at, and expanding, supporting, providing different opportunities.

We did have the Central STEAM night.

About 60 families participated, about a third of the school showed up for Central for that event.

Really a great collaboration for our district.

Just a lot of different opportunities there for the kids.

Robotics team was there from the middle school and high school.

Really nice cooperative effort there, and just a nice community outreach.

PBIS has continued to be a really strong focus in all our four elementary buildings.

Everyone's at different levels, different pieces with that.

But lots of time and energy being focused on teaching and practicing expectations, and also acknowledging and celebrating the many positive things we're seeing in our schools.

It's been really nice to kind of shift that focus, recognizing the kids from doing the right things and celebrating as whole buildings are great levels.

Also continued efforts to share tokens for the book vending machines.

Those have been in the buildings for about a year now, or just shy of a year.

Christ Child Society provided a really generous donation for us to buy books.

So we've been able to use those and community to get those tokens in kids' hands and get books in other kids' hands.

We're aiming again for three to four books per year.

It's kind of our target.

So that's a really nice opportunity there as well.

Huge thank you to Nubs and Av.

They reached out and gave us an opportunity to get our kids out to learn the ski program through Scott's Skiers Fund.

And we are lucky enough to have that in our backyard and get a lot of our kids on the ski hills in the next couple weeks.

And then in spite of the weather, we have had several efforts to work with our winter sports park for some days for winter fun days.

Today would have been a good day.

We canceled ours.

So weather as a cooperative, we're still trying to make sure we have some fun things built in and just creative solutions for kids.

Rich play is coming up.

Rockin' Robin Hood, we have trials complete.

There are 62 students currently working together for the upcoming spring shows.

And then quick update on some upcoming events.

Central Carnival is February 23rd.

Lincoln is March 1st.

Sheridan moved theirs April 12th because we ended up with a conflict on Northman night.

So we shifted ours back.

March is reading month is coming up.

So we're excited to add some more events and activities to celebrate and encourage reading.

And we have parent-s year conferences coming up March 12th and 14th.

And again, those in worship play dates are April 18th, 19th, and 20th.

And we'll have more information coming up for that Rockin' Robin Hood performance.

Thank you.

Okay, middle school.

Lots going on.

We recently had our spelling bee.

Cala Vicente took first, eighth grader, and then a sixth grader.

We had Jayden Tang, sixth grader, took second.

Both of them will be going on to regionals in charter city on March 16th.

Map counts, seven of our eighth graders went and competed.

And as a team took third.

We also had individuals take third place, fourth place, and fifth place.

So, pretty cool.

February 7th, we had our seventh and eighth grade bands had their tree festival concert.

And it went well.

February 21st through the 23rd, we are hosting actual festivals.

And our seventh and eighth grade bands will be performing on the night of the 22nd.

They're pretty good.

Eighth grade ski day was today.

Again, thanks to Nubnub for opening up their facilities to our kids.

And by all accounts, everybody had a great time.

Lots going on with eighth grade.

Also this week, Wednesday, yesterday, our eighth graders went and toured all the CTE programs that are available at Boston High School.

It's kind of perfect timing because we start our four-year planning process February 20th.

So, students can go and see what's available to them and spark their interest.

So, huge thanks to high school counselors, Jamie, Whitley, and administration of high school and then our counselors at the middle school for making that happen.

A lot of hands going to that.

Also on the seventh, we had our middle school parent alliance meeting.

We talked about our school report card and school index scores, which are both accountability measures through the Michigan Department of Education.

And they were definitely mostly favorable.

And I also should point out, or would like to point out, that U.

S.

News and World Report ranked Toski Middle School as a best middle school.

The committee talked about this.

Well, that's what the best middle school is like to type.

[applause] As a committee, we thought it would be good to get more -- to get this information out more.

So, that's why I'm going to be sharing tonight.

PD Day tomorrow, we are going to spend a lot of time working on furthering to develop our skills with differentiating instruction, which is a goal our staff developed together at the beginning of the year.

And then also upcoming, our eighth grade is going into D.

C.

March 4th through the 9th.

And Career Day is on March 13th.

And if you haven't been to Career Day, I would ask that you come and see.

It's pretty cool.

March 13th, we have almost 30 community members coming in and presenting to our students.

They take an interest survey beforehand and our counselors pair them with community members who have different jobs, you know, all different jobs.

This year, our keynote speaker is going to be our chief of police, Rocky Tarnar.

That will be a good day.

That's it.

Thank you.

>> We're in school.

Back here too.

Echoing what John said, having an eighth grade visit was super exciting to welcome them.

All the CTE teachers did presentations to all the classes.

We also had sports and club expo in the cafeteria.

Simon was one of our students, our student advisory members who organized that expo so the students had a chance to connect with all the different clubs and opportunities.

And then Jamie also helped our advisory committee set up a panel.

So that was new this year where they got to sit and listen to some current students, share their experience, and get some questions asked.

And then also new this year, we added lunch.

So all the eighth graders sat down and had lunch with -- in the high school and got to experience the different lines and choices.

So super fun.

Thank you to the counseling, both counseling teams and Jamie for pulling that together.

And our students, our student advisory committee, and then CTE all had students that took the students around.

We had parent-teacher conferences last week.

During those, we had scheduling meetings, so we started that, offered that for eighth through 11th grade parents to talk about different opportunities.

We also kicked off -- I know Bill mentioned that -- Fast Fall money, we are using that $10,000, some of it already to get teachers trained.

And I was part of that training.

Jamie, I think, was to three hours of lots of information.

I mean, it is an interesting process and a lot of information you need.

So we have, I guess, probably 12 teachers that were trained that are going to be able to sit down with families and help them get all that information in.

So we're excited to keep working on that.

And then, of course, teachers were available to meet with parents that came.

Next Thursday, we are doing a practice PSAT/SAT day.

So every freshman, sophomore, and junior will have a chance to sit down for that two-hour and 14-minute practice test in the Blue Book, College Board Blue Book, online.

Our counseling staff went to all the English classes for three days a couple weeks ago, got them all into their College Board accounts.

So we're going to try it out.

We're going to give them that opportunity.

So we're excited to see how that online version goes.

Seniors during that time will have an opportunity to work with our counseling team and then some of our teachers that don't have second hours to do NCMC orientation.

So they're going to come and do orientation with all of our seniors that are going there next year.

We're going to do college applications for students that still need to apply, scholarship writing, FAFSA training, some different opportunities for seniors.

So once students take this practice test, the nice thing is College Board links that into Khan Academy and will personalize their practice.

And we know students who practice 20 hours or more score on average 100 points better on the SAT.

So that will get that linked up so they can do some personalized practice.

Teachers can use that as anchor activities in the classroom.

So we're excited to get that done.

And then just celebration, we had another exciting homecoming last week.

Our student leadership crew did an excellent job organizing a puff assembly and a dance on Saturday.

That was fun for all.

So just one real quick comment on that.

It was a while ago since my kids went from 8th grade to the high school.

I'm happy to see that working because I feel that you guys do such a great job of taking care of kids as they move through each hallway.

And then you just end up sort of swimming in the deep end as a 9th grader as you get there.

And it's nice to see this changing a little bit.

You know, there's those days to go there and work on your whatever locker stuff.

But go there and see where the CTE rooms even are to understand how the lunch works.

All those things, it's got to be comforting for those people as they move into the high school.

So thank you for doing that.

Alright, District Teaching and Learning.

Little North and Tree School registration is open.

The file ends the same as I think our registration.

We already have 40,000 vendors coming up.

And there's people sitting on the right.

So people can go to our website.

We have a whole day of TV for teachers tomorrow.

The elementary will be working on writing which is focused on assessments.

Key writing and guidance.

Strategies to support self-awareness and self-management.

Part 2, which is section 1.

And then our attentive teachers are going to show away elementary to work with all the elementary essentials and the IFC to have a celebration.

They're very excited about that.

I'll skip PMS because Mr.

Wilk has already told you what they're doing tomorrow.

The high school is going to be working on PBIS, PFA, PFAT.

We'll be hearing up for that and curriculum assessment.

All of the schools will use our data dialogue process that I just brought to share with you on the task.

They're all going to be using that to analyze the survey data for students and staff that went out earlier in the year.

And then we have four staff members going to the McCall conference.

Anna Walker, she received a high school, she received a scholarship through UNSTOM.

Which would be a little bit of a go on a scholarship.

We're excited for that as well.

And that is it.

Thank you.

Alright.

I think that moves that to us.

Board of Education reports.

Anybody?

Anybody?

Yeah, today I went and did, I've been at the other for about two and a half weeks.

So I went to Central's new, and I'm going to say this word really poorly because I don't know how to say it, Prometheus.

Is that right?

Prometheus.

Yeah.

Yes, that.

To watch different grade levels interact with the new board and how they can get up and touch the board and do their math problems or draw on it or whatever.

And the teacher can set up their curriculum through it.

I watched fourth grade do their math with Mr.

Fouser and they were able to get up and write the different equations and different things.

And it was really interesting to see from fourth grade to first grade to kindergarten how they all kind of interacted a little bit the same way where it really had them focus in and enjoy and be really engaged.

And I thought that was very interesting.

So that new technology, I can see a future of growth and collaborations between fifth grade and kindergarten.

And where they can pull information years to come with it and build different things to help them grow.

I don't have a lot to report.

I'm going to have application there.

And I did see the dot activation from science, which was very cool.

And I'm really glad you encouraged us to see that because I would have missed out on that.

So thank you Becky for that.

I went to the PBIS assembly at Ottawa.

Oh, you were fine.

So thanks for the invite.

Last week I attended the MASC labor relations conference.

So there was a lot of good information about the repeal of right to work and what that means in terms of prohibited items of bargaining.

They're no longer prohibited.

So I did send out the information from that conference for you guys to review.

I do have some notes that I'm putting together.

So some more information will be coming.

And then I went to district teaching and learning yesterday.

I also was at district teaching and learning yesterday.

I also went to the Ottawa PBIS, which was so fun.

It was so fun to see all the very super excited about the focus boards that they were working on and take part in the activity.

And I just peered with peer guidance and learned something I don't have a chance to learn.

And then also went to the central STEAM night.

And that was great.

It was so great to see.

I did that too.

Yeah, you were there.

I forgot about all the stuff I did.

We've been flying together.

Just to see the families so engaged in learning with their kids about making snowflakes, house snowflakes.

And everything that they were doing was really so wonderful.

It's so cool.

I mean, every room that I went to was packed.

So that was really great.

That was a really great note.

Yeah, it was a great note.

The organization that they did and the different things that they offered.

And the different levels that they were at.

It was amazing.

And how engaged the parents were with the kids.

Well, you guys call it a PBIS assembly.

I call it a superhero assembly.

These will beat you guys.

You can run around in capes.

So yeah, it was fun.

I had a good time too.

I had an interesting kid and we had a great time.

I think we really enjoyed it.

Try it Tuesday, I usually talk about.

But that's next Tuesday.

I'm going to tell you it's grapefruit.

So I'm letting the cat out of the bag there.

Saw one of those book vending machines work for the first time.

That is just so fun.

But when a book almost didn't fall, I almost had to be like when I was a kid.

You know, you shake those darn chips out of there.

But it worked.

Went to a basketball game.

Our auxiliary floor looks wonderful.

Thought I suppose it still has a dead spot.

By the refill line.

Home court of fame.

Yeah, there you go.

You just dribble around that.

And then that's the piece of foundation.

And to be honest, I know there's something I probably should say, but I can't remember.

All right.

On to financial report.

In your packet, we say the format that we report on every month.

Obviously, that's going through a lot of numbers.

You can see in the reading, revenues and expenditures are where we expect them to be.

Expect the affinity here pretty close to what we showed in that revised budget that you just proved this evening.

The other thing I'll say is we have started monthly treasurer and finance director meetings.

And we have the first of those this month.

It gives the treasurer the chance to just meet and talk, ask questions or get information if you like.

So can you explain that to me?

Oh, the treasurer and the finance director.

Once a month.

Got you.

That treasurer.

Yeah, that's good.

That's what you need to do to learn.

Terrific.

Thanks for doing that.

All right.

So we had pre-festival band.

So seventh grade, eighth grade.

We got 90 plus seventh graders.

And then the two high school bands.

I mean, they were just awesome.

They're just incredible.

We got some athletic events.

We had a ski meet out there.

And now we have the Duke or so will go.

So you'll see all that.

That's not something that I'm used to doing.

Just a handful of other things going on.

Jim Kim.

So we're going to have a tribute for him.

The Jim Kim tribute open house is going to be a week from this Saturday.

So that's going to be February 24th from 4 to 7 p.

m.

in the Toskey High School cafeteria.

So we're starting green and north and blue.

We're going to write a note to Jim or send a video message.

Enjoy live entertainment.

He's great food.

Put in your favorite silent auction items.

They're asking for a goodwill offering for admission.

All proceeds raised will be used to offset the cost of home health care for Jim.

So he was able to FaceTime with us a little bit during P.

E.

F.

on Monday.

So we're all hoping for the best there.

The pizza pizzazz that's a fundraiser for the education foundation.

So that's getting moved.

It was originally going to be a week from.

It was going to be the last Monday in February.

So that's going to be moved Monday, March 4th.

So we're going to get more information about that.

So the proceeds of that goes to support the education foundation.

And all of our capital improvement projects for this summer, they're going to go out to bid tomorrow.

So the stadium athletic turf replacement, those bids are going to be due on Thursday, March 7th.

So that's a quick turnaround.

Then we've got the high school parking lot replacement.

Ottawa Elementary, the driveway and sidewalk replacement.

And Central Elementary, their bus loop and they've got some concrete work and all that stuff at the bell tower.

So those bids are going to be due on Tuesday, March 12th.

And our plan is to award all the bids at the April board meeting.

So the Tower Pinkster and OAK, they've got everything right on schedule.

Which turf company are we choosing or are we going to do a couple different ones?

Put it out for bid.

Are you talking about design?

No, like are we going to go, you know, a couple different companies.

So AstroTurf, we're doing AstroTurf, we're doing FieldTurf, we're doing whatever.

Have we made that decision?

I go in there.

Okay.

Do you want me to answer that?

That's really fine.

I can ask him.

Well, I, yeah.

But I think that's got to be the time he gets to do it.

Well, it also depends what you want to have.

Because we've had AstroTurf and they've been fairly good at coming back and fixing the little.

I would recommend AstroTurf.

They've got a new and improved version.

[Inaudible] Is that all for me, sir?

That's it.

Okay.

This is our second opportunity for audience participation.

I have a couple here.

A couple filling, a couple out.

Moni, is that correct?

Moni.

Shoot.

Moni.

My apologies, I really am.

So I would just like to say, [Inaudible] And I also want to speak about other issues, since Montessori's financial problem is such a big one.

I get called Pocahontas on a daily at the high school and middle school and I get called red sand.

So that's one problem.

We've got drug issues, people go into the bathroom and bake and stuff.

I feel like there are so many more moral issues that you guys should be focusing on and also that society should be focusing on.

But when it really all comes down to it, it really just compares to money.

That's what I feel like you've shown me since you've been Montessori.

I'm not trying to be disrespectful, but it is factual.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Dr.

Leslie, according to an article published by the Patoski News Review on August 3rd of 2022, you stated that you wanted to, quote, prioritize transparency within the district.

As far as contrast to that pledge, every discussion and decision regarding the Patoski Montessori Children's House of any substance has happened in closed session.

To date, no minutes for any of these sessions have been provided.

Myself and other parents who have inquired have been persistently met with a variety of inconsistent reasons for your hesitancy.

A lack of coherent and consistent messaging suggests that there's an ineffectiveness and a lack of leadership in this administration.

Thank you.

Russell.

Did you want to wait?

Okay.

I don't think necessarily it is my space, my place to speak here.

I mean, I, it doesn't represent the model of what it should be, which is to give people respect for the dignity.

I mean, this is a really heartbreaking thing for me.

It's particularly heartbreaking where the actions of some people who are supposedly of 25% score have done damage to it.

I think the score is more than that.

I think it's more than certain people.

I have opposed it before and I oppose it again.

I think it's a good presentation.

So, I mean, I've had talks with people and they've brought up some issues that, although I don't necessarily agree with, I do respect.

I think it would be much more useful to really discuss those issues, rather than the things that we're focused on in this presentation.

Again, I don't understand the issues on the modern society.

And if there's a will to reconcile it, or at least, you know, if the modern society was states of willingness to have reduced amount of money, then I feel like that's, you know, it's just a priority.

I mean, I also understand why you're concerned that if there is reduced funding, how is, how is services going to be provided to children.

I think this should be focused on significant issues that face some kinds of issues, and not be.

Thank you.

I'm sorry, I didn't read it.

My apologies.

No problem.

My apologies.

Matthew Loesky.

Same address as before, so I'll skip that part.

So, I just wanted to, I did serve on the Montessori board for a period of time when my daughter was in school and that was a commitment that my dad and stepmom and sisters urged me to do.

So I say this with some understanding of the difficult choice making that you have to have and have a budget and you have to make funding.

But as I listened to some of the concerns that were expressed I was on the board for approximately four years, I think.

And I say this with no animals for you all, and I don't know that you were there, but I don't think most of you were, but no one from the school board ever actually coached us about any concerns or I apologize.

So for instance, reference to licensing issues, those are real concerns.

I work as an attorney and I do a lot of work in court with the use of life.

I work with individuals in common with those who are teachers at the school.

All of us who have students in the district are taxpayers, so you're getting my tax money.

You were getting it before you were at Montessori.

I can tell you that the level of administrative support we received, which is the administrative fee that's part of the contract, was amazing.

So thinking about that from a board perspective, I've voiced as a board member my frustration is that we don't have the funding for that.

How much are we paying for the school?

It seems like we should be getting a little bit more.

Or well forgiven.

Because you are getting our people funding based on enrollment.

So I think that really what could benefit is open dialogue.

I think not in the environment where you have attorneys talking, I don't want to talk myself out of work.

It sounds to me like your guys' mind is made up.

If that was the case, I would be here and my daughter probably had some tears in my heart.

I hope that what made you want to receive it, I understand your position.

But I think, and I would say this is for the Montessori books, come back and think about what's important, which is all of the kids that sit here tonight, and voice to their experiences that were a positive educational experience, and ask yourself often, "Does that happen this year?

" That's what I'm asking again.

Montessori is difficult.

It isn't for everybody.

I think I'm exaggerating what my grandkids were here earlier.

I would just say this, one of them both went to Montessori at one point, one completed theirs, one went to the State High School because she was an instructor.

That's what I'm saying.

We're victim captives for folks.

Here's what we're saying.

Thank you very much for doing that, Abby.

Natalie Waltz?

I'm on the Montessori board.

We've worked diligently.

We want you to know we're open to negotiations.

We never knew that negotiations were ceasing.

We were happy with the 5%.

The industry standard, 7 to 11%.

It was 20% for some time.

There's a lot of room in between 20 and 5%.

We want to sit down with you.

We want to have a conversation with you.

We requested that, and we were denied.

We want open communication.

We want there to be a bridge, not a gap.

So there are various Montessori members who couldn't make it tonight for various reasons.

We've prepared a statement, so I'm going to read it.

But ultimately we're all just very sad at the end of the day.

I'm sad and disappointed.

I am a Patoski resident and PMCH board member.

We are so proud of our partnership with Patoski Public Schools.

And access and opportunity has afforded students to grow, learn, and truly flourish, like all of the students you heard here tonight.

As a board, we have attempted to build bridges by inviting the board and central office to this school multiple times in the last five years.

And it's disheartening to hear the Board of Ed reports, and none of them included us.

And here's been the olive branch, and there's been the invitation.

Yet, we remain this island.

And we're trying to work through that.

There were meetings.

Board member Rebecca Roth and President Byron attended an in-person meeting and a second meeting that occurred that also included board member Jesse Coleman.

Ms.

Smith was there from PSP.

Mr.

Mulching, the CFO, was not present either.

Bill, Kathy, Mark were also present.

So simply by who was present at those meetings, I'll lead you to believe that there was some indication about test scores, and that was discussed.

And so I'm confused by that presentation that Dr.

Leslie gave that said that wasn't the case.

Because our recollection and our meetings were of a different nature.

As a board, neither us nor our attorney stated that we wanted to quit negotiating.

To insinuate we were playing games is both rude and careless and offensive.

We want to continue to support children.

We are here for the community and we want to be a spouse for the community, and we encourage you again.

Please meet with us.

Please reconsider.

We are open to negotiation.

We are happy with the 5%.

All of the other things that you presented in there, you had already turned down and we said fine.

That's okay.

We want to remain open.

The 5% is good.

So I hope that we hear from you soon.

Thank you for your comments.

I do appreciate it.

Amber Neil.

Hi, Heather.

I am also a board member and a parent of the Pachamua-Bapton Montessori.

And I just wanted to say, first of all, this has been a huge learning experience for me to be on the board.

I'm a scientist by trade and I work at fungus and bugs and trees and playbooks.

And so I've learned a lot and I appreciate as much transparency and open dialogue.

Because I learned from that way rather than hearing about the pie charts of attorney conversations.

And so I just wanted to reiterate, kind of Matthew Lesty said it really well, like, I want to continue open dialogue so that I can understand and I can weigh in.

And I guess I thought I still had that opportunity and I hope that I still do.

And I'm willing to talk to whoever and try to work out something that's going to work.

Because we all love this school.

We love our children.

We want it to keep functioning.

And we had a good name, so hopefully we can keep going.

Thank you for your comments.

[inaudible] So two pieces of feedback.

The Petoskey Public School Board are the elected officials.

You are the policy makers for the public school board.

You have hired staff.

In my experience as an elected official as well, Sadeet Petoskey, our board minutes, our board packets are prepared by staff.

In the county, in the city, on the public school board, you are fed the information by your staff.

Now, I'm not going to say spoon fed because you are presented with the information to make decisions.

It is very uncommon for any elected officials to go against the recommendations of staff.

Very unusual.

There are times when that happens.

But because you are basing this on what appears to be control and financial, just remember that you are fiduciarily responsible for public funds.

This is not a business, Kathy.

And I heard you mention business.

These are public funds of how we disperse tax money from the city of Petoskey coffers.

And I want to know the role of the Charim ISD.

The city of Petoskey voters have never turned down the millage.

This community steadfast.

You could go to Bear Creek Township, city of Petoskey Resort Township.

All of those will pass a millage on for public good, whether that's a police, fire and safety millage or Charim ISD millage.

That is your point of leverage for Petoskey voters.

Thank you.

Thank you, Lindsay.

Liz Cohen.

Again, and I don't have prepared comments this time.

It's not going to be good.

I'm.

But that does not represent.

I'm a very understanding person.

I don't have a different approach.

It's very clearly.

And I think you could tell from the statements here that we are a group of people that would really like to work with you.

I am not on the board.

I don't know what if I'm allowed to do anything, but I will sit with you in any room and I will negotiate.

I mean, I just want the school and I don't know that any of us realized how much in peril it was, including the members of our board who were working so hard to do what's right for the students.

So it seems as though.

Signals got cost.

And I can understand your frustration with.

Instead, we're sad or transpired, but I think that we will get through the whole.

We're ready to talk and we hope that you'll listen and talk with us.

We want to know what you have to say.

Thank you.

Get more blue.

Anybody else?

I don't know how many of you were.

And over the course of the last year, we have seen a lot of rally happening with our school board.

I don't know who else in this room actually sat through every single superintendent interview this summer that Dr.

I was at every and it was in the summer and it was not fun.

I will tell you that after last night.

So I realize that there are people who are angry.

But let me tell you that I've gotten to know him and his responses and response to the anger that he felt.

So while I know that there's a lot of anger and a lot of frustration that is being felt in today.

Let us not go back to the place where we were two years ago because this community came a long way to try to heal from that.

And our teachers and our students suffered because of that.

And we've done a lot to heal.

And Dr.

Leslie has been allowed to feel that that he's not able to feel that.

We all adhere to the rule that we take steps backward that we think about what's in the absolute best interest of our children, that we all do that in this room and that we not forget where we come from and where we need to go on a moving forward basis.

Because I for one don't want to have to sit through another round of anything, any summer, any time soon.

And I don't think any of us do either.

So I just beg of you to please, please, please keep all of that in mind as we move forward because we owe that to the students and our students.

Thank you.

Thank you.

All right, Kristen and I don't know how to say this.

Hey, thank you very much.

So I just want to apologize for that open letter.

I don't think it represents the parents as a whole of Montessori.

And it's certainly not my viewpoint.

I contacted our board immediately when that letter came out and I found it appalling.

And I did tell the board that I was ready to pull in the teacher.

I was ready to pull my students the next day if the boys didn't come up and have their own stance and not support that letter.

So I want to apologize.

That is a poor representation.

And I don't want you to think it is a representation of the entire community.

So my apologies.

I do want to say that I think this is a miscommunication.

But I think it's around its base in the trouble Montessori school has had in the past two or three years.

And I'm new to the school.

I've only been there a year.

I moved here because of the top three Montessori school by this district.

And I think the board is doing their best to help turn the school around.

And I think perhaps personality clash and communication was lost.

And I don't know as a parent of the top three Montessori that our board communicated well.

And I apologize to Dr.

Leslie for that.

And I can see the financial.

I do want you to know that it would be a shame to stop all of these kids from having such a wonderful education and be supported by.

But would you get the same support and would these kids get the same support?

I can't say that's true.

And it's not the solution.

And I just want to say I find it sad that the gentleman that has done such an amazing job is going to be in the position that he's in.

And I'm sorry to all the parents and for my own children, my own child, that one or two personality clashes with a truly good heart and intent, or perhaps a poor way of communicating it with other people in a relationship and agreement that leadership perhaps was poor.

And I think a lot of kids are going to suffer because of that.

I'm sorry.

And I hope perhaps you guys will consider that the board is doing their best to find money to support the children.

And I think they didn't look at it from the top.

And that was a that was a conversation I had with the board of the top team out of story.

But it was after they had already come through.

And I think it's sad that there's no communication happening.

And I apologize for the room.

Jocelyn Norcross.

We got to make that choice.

The reason that all of these people are here tonight is not to stay open.

They wanted to stay open to everyone.

Because the school can go.

The school doesn't want to go private because the people in this room.

The things that the people in the monitor.

Choose not to return to negotiation.

a clash of personalities, which I think we clearly all saw in the presentation tonight with all due respect.

There's other people in this room who deserve their equality.

By choosing not to return to negotiations, you're telling our community that we're OK if the only kids who will benefit from a Montessori education are those who can pay for it.

And that is a shame.

Thank you.

One more.

I'm following the guys.

It's kind of an out-of-back subject.

So I just want to-- like I said, I just kind of learned about this recently.

And I don't know if I was out of the algorithms on Facebook.

I had a couple Montessori families get a hold of me.

And they're on me.

And we had a ton of our kids.

Youth Services, LTVD, which we had for a little while when we were a little more staffed with grants.

We had transportation Montessori.

So we are education partners and the tutoring services inside of Montessori at one point, I believe.

And it all just took different staffing.

And I work in tribal government.

I know Denise has.

And there's times where we work with other entities.

And there's times when people butt heads.

And I think you have to grow a fixed skin when you work in schools and in government.

And what I would just encourage Dr.

Leslie is really think about the bigger picture and that's the kids.

I have to work with people sometimes that maybe we aren't on the same page.

But what we try to do is refocus on the kids.

Let personal things just go and really remember that it's youth focused.

It's student focused.

And I apologize.

I don't know what happened with all of the other stuff that's going on.

But we want to work with you.

Like I said, we're planning on once you get in a youth center, we're trying to build one for one of the classes to serve DASC students.

We've served-- just in this last grant that I have, we've served 125 local tribal students.

And that's not just tribal students.

Others are tribal students that live in the area.

We also pick up kids from Concord.

So we're huge.

We want to make sure that we keep our partnership with Montessori and that it's available, especially for our tribal youth.

We've had most of the kids inherit tribal.

So just really consider that.

We're a good partner with a lot of other outside entities outside the Little Travis Lee Band.

We want to keep it that way.

So I know tribal leadership is learning a lot.

I can't speak for them.

But I do know that this is a really big year for us.

So we really encourage you.

I do have you come in.

I love our students.

I know you do too.

Everybody up here, that's a great day to be here.

So I just want to say we've had a great time tonight.

It is emotional.

It's great you guys all get to come and have a great day.

And then for all the students, we're going to do a second.

So thank you.

I feel like I don't want to make-- against my better judgment, I'm going to say, does anybody else that would like to speak?

Yeah, or in the back.

Yeah.

I would like to apologize for interrupting you, Dr.

Leslie.

That was inappropriate of me.

And I want to model correct behavior for my children.

So I do want to apologize.

I will say it's very frustrating as somebody who was at one and a half of the meetings that we had.

I will say my notes, I look back on them.

Don't include much discussion about the finances.

There was a lot of discussion about curriculum, about oversight.

I did not see much discussion on my notes about the finances.

Because I think starting solidly when you guys said, we put out an ask.

You said no, understandably.

You start high.

That was the intention, I think, with the negotiations.

OK, you gave the 5%.

We said, great, let's do it.

And then we thought we were having more communications along.

How will we proceed in upcoming years?

And that's when some of the other concerns came about.

And so I was frustrated that we're saying, hey, this is where we're at.

They're asking for all this stuff.

And we don't want to give it.

And understandably so.

When you put the numbers up like you had them up, they get it.

But we did feel comfortable and confident with your match back.

And we thought we were moving forward.

So it's, again, disappointing.

And I do, though, want to apologize for speaking out of turn.

Thank you.

So being a long time parent, a long time ago, all this is new.

Like some of the people, I've just really learned about all this stuff right away.

And so looking out, I haven't read the open letter.

And I'll read it, but it sounds like it's pretty shitty.

So one, I want to echo what Rusty said.

There is not with my story culture.

That is not what we learn, that's not what we do.

But it seems here like there is just a real breakdown of relationship.

So the question I have for the school board is, again, Dr.

Leslie, are you open to opening that communication, that dialogue?

Because obviously, there's a learning lesson.

And I don't mean it disrespectfully to the current board.

But there's some governance issues, and there's some stuff to learn.

And that's what I do.

And I'll happily help you.

But I just want to know, can you see yourself going forward?

Because I think-- wait, Tina.

I'm sorry, I don't know your name.

Kristin.

But it's really-- it's a heading down to the kids.

And let's get the troublesome relationship and the inappropriate behavior out of the picture and see if we can come up with a solution.

So that's really-- so I'm sorry.

I'm not being part of it.

But seeing all these beautiful children who are there and my kids are there, I just-- I'm just so sad to see this.

And our eldest personally wants to move back.

And they want their kids to go to Montessori.

And I'm just like, shit, I'm not going to be anybody.

I'm sorry.

[LAUGHTER] Back to move back to the past, because it's not going to be something to do with the show.

So I appreciate all that you're doing.

I know a lot of you up here are-- I know it's a lot in your face, but I think it's-- can everybody just shed it?

And can we get back to-- let's have a conversation to help me make this work, really for the kids and financially for the school.

I'm sorry.

Can both of you say your names again?

I've been a lot of people.

Sorry, no problem.

Rebecca Roth.

I spoke earlier.

Cindy McShirley.

Thank you.

I have one quick thing.

I'm sorry.

Marsha Webster.

I'm a class resident as well.

I was served on the Montessori board for eight years.

And I think it's really important for everyone in this room to understand if you have a fund on the Montessori board, it's kind of under the logistics behind that.

Those are volunteer positions.

They're voted on by other board members within the Montessori.

So there were so many hard decisions over just the eight years that I served on the board that we had to come up with and figuring things out.

But these are either parents or interested individuals who are looking to grow and work with the Montessori.

So when you hear of the dynamics that have happened, they're going to change.

The relationship path over 20 years, you hadn't had-- according to my knowledge, I had done their financial reviews where we had to ask.

And so there's a lot of what individuals said that were positive or negative.

These are volunteer parents most likely in the situation.

They're not voted on by the district.

And they're put in positions that maybe they have never been in before, too.

So it is a very high pressure position to be in when you're trying to make some decisions moving forward.

We just want to keep that in mind of everyone here, including the board, that everyone does the best they can during their term.

But they may not have the experience or the knowledge on proper communications to go into meetings and also financial reports and understanding how they work.

And as a business owner myself, it was kind of daunting to come in and try to figure out and navigate what that looks like.

But I think it's really important to know that those positions also can be voted out and out.

So if that's something that would make a difference moving forward, that could be something that could be addressed moving forward as well.

Thank you very much.

Yes?

I'm Hannah Vannos.

I wanted to make a comment that was similar to that.

But I just wanted to, I guess, mention that boards are temporary.

This relationship has been going on for more than 20 years.

Board terms are generally very short.

And so it's really sad that we are changing something that has been here in the community for more than 20 years based primarily on your interactions with one board member for which you have clashed with, understandably.

I mean, understandably.

And it's just really unfortunate that the fate of the school is really going to be based on your interactions with one temporary parent that you have interacted with.

Thank you for your comments.

Thank you, everybody.

I appreciate all your comments.

We really do.

When we read, I read all of the emails.

I really have every last little piece.

So thank you very much for sending those along.

Motion to adjourn?
