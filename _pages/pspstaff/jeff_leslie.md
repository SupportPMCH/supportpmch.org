# Dr Jeff Leslie
## Superintendent

- [PSP Email - jleslie@northmen.org](mailto:jleslie@northmen.org)

Dr Jeff Leslie was hired in the summer of 2022 after approval from the District Board of Education held a during special meeting. According to [news reports](https://www.petoskeynews.com/story/news/education/2022/08/03/new-petoskey-superintendent-hired-prioritizes-district-transparency/10214492002/) at the time, he was hired at $160k a year, more than $12,000 more than the previous superintendent.

Quoting the article:
> To help fix the culture in Petoskey schools, Leslie said he wants to listen to the staff, administration, parents and students to hear what their concerns are and then prioritize transparency within the district.

We should remind Dr Leslie of his promise to prioritize transparency within the district. In stark contrast to this pledge, the vast majority of conversations regarding the fate of PMCH have happened in closed sessions of the board, for which no minutes have been published.
