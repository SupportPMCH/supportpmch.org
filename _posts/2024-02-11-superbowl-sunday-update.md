## Preparing for the February School Board Meeting

We've been working frantically to get ready for the upcoming PSP Board meeting, this Thursday. In addition to spreading the word and rallying support, we've been diving deep into public records, compiling and highlighting relevant information for publication on this website.

We've added a new [Resources](/resources) page to make it easier to find and understand the importance of all of the documents we've analyzed so far. Where relevant, we've also included links to some of the resources we utilize in conducting our research.

## Getting the word out

We've created the following flyer to circulate among the community. If you've got some paper and ink to spare, please consider leaving a few copies of these anywhere the public frequents. We have just a few short days to raise as much awareness as possible.
