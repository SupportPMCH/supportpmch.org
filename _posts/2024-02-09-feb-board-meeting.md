# Urgent call for support

## School board meeting Thursday, February 15 7pm

It has come to our attention that the Petoskey Montessori Children's House is on the agenda for discussion at the next PSP School Board meeting, Thursday February 15th at 7pm. We are asking that all Petoskey Residents who are able come out and voice your support for the PMCH.

We know that this is very short notice, we only learned of this ourselves this morning.
