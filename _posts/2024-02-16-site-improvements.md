## Site Improvements

We've updated the theme used on this site to allow us better control over layout and organizational elements. Hopefully the site is a little more usable as a result. We will continue to make refinements as time allows.

## Resources page updates

We've added a number of additional documents to the [resources](/resources/) section, as well as reorganizing and reformatting the page for easier access. Along with a number of PDF's, we've added the transcript from last nights PSP Board Meeting, as well as a letter passed along to us by a supporter.

## What we're working on

### Feb 15 Meeting
We are looking to get copies of the presentation made by [Dr Leslie](/_pages/pspstaff/jeff_leslie), as well as the source files used to compile that presentation. We wish to understand the screen shot's from documents in their original context, and verify that they pertained to the matter of PSP Management Agreement Renewal as claimed. We anticipate filing a FOIA request early next week for these materials.

What leads us to question the veracity of the claims made?

It wasn't the incoherent wandering presentation which covered numerous irrelevant points while ignoring the merits of the matter.

It wasn't Dr Leslie making it clear that in the June 30th follow up meeting, he'd concluded there was no path forward, "so we talked about the NWA test scores" and other topics which any normal person would take to represent interest in working cooperatively and into the future. ( You can find this starting on line 2405 of [the transcript](/assets/files/transcripts/psp_feb_15_board_meeting_transcript.txt) )

No, its mainly that we recall having seen some of the documents and information in his presentation. For example the **$9,500** mortgage cost stands out in particular. It is our understanding that the cost cited there is actually in reference to a brand new building, which exists only in the form of a drawing and a lot of aspirations.

That Dr Leslie doesn't _know the facts_ here, after being responsible for the outcome for this long now, doesn't inspire confidence in his abilities as an administrator. Not just at the point of that conversation in June, but last night at this meeting. To be unprepared to that extent during the school board meeting is unexpected. We found his presentation disrespectful and patronizing.

### PMCH Documents

We are working to obtain and publish a number of additional documents from PMCH to gain a fuller understanding of the circumstances, and share both the documents and our findings with the broader community. In addition to the documents we've already published, we are seeking the Board of Trustee meeting minutes, and any relevant financial documents to understand the operating expenses of the school.

In an email circulated late last night, a resident expressed frustration at the lack of transparency on the side of PMCH. We are going to seek the documents involved from the PMCH side of the negotiation, in order to ensure we have the most complete understanding of the circumstances possible, and to help address the concerns raised in that email.

One portion of the email asserts that there was "only one sole issue" that lead to the decision by the school board. This does not align with our experience over the last year, and it was clear by the reaction of many other residents at the meeting last night, specifically several current PMCH BOT members, that this latest reason was a complete surprise. Only documents will provide a clear picture, and this question is prime among the ones we seek to answer.

When you consider that, along with Dr Leslie's _own statements_ captured in [the transcript](/assets/files/transcripts/psp_feb_15_board_meeting_transcript.txt) on line 2275, "You know, so he had like 32 concerns with issues." with respect to PSP Lawyers, there's clearly much more that we don't know than we do. We hope to learn more about these 32 concerns, however because they came in the form of legal opinion, it's unlikely that we will be able to obtain them via the FOIA process.

We hope that through our continued efforts we will be able to provide a conclusive answer to this and other questions in the near future.

## What would you like to see?

Do you have questions about either the PSP District or the PMCH that you've been unable to find answers to? We welcome questions from the public and will try to address any questions or concerns that come our way. [info@supportpmch.org](mailto:info@supportpmch.org)
