# Research Resources

This page is an attempt to provide links to the most heavily relied upon resources used in our research efforts. It is by no means exhaustive, and is instead intended to serve as giving credit to providers of other sources.

## Source Documents

**PSP Management Agreements / Legal documents**

**PMCH**
- [2020~2022 Montessori Agreement](/assets/files/Montessori_Agreement_20-22.pdf)
	- This document is the Management Agreement under which PMCH and PSP have operated for many years. Crucially, this document outlines the **20%** management fee that PSP has been charging for over 20 years. This is the most recent copy of the standard 2 year renewal document that has historically been used. We endeavor to obtain copies of previous years agreements, going back as far as 2000.
- [October 2023 Amendment](/assets/files/2023-2024_Mgt_Agreement_Amendment.pdf)
	- This document changes the management fee from it's previous rate of **20%** to a new rate of **5%**, however it also consequently only applies until the summer of 2024.
- [Management Agreement Appendices](/assets/files/Montessori_Agreement_Appendices.pdf)
	- These provide additional terms and definitions for elements referenced in the main agreement document.
- [Payments FY 2020-21](/assets/files/Montessori_Payments_FY_2020-21.pdf)

**PSP**
- [PSP District Improvement Plan](/assets/files/2023.2024_dip.pdf)
	- This document specifically claims that certain assessments and community feedback were conducted at all district schools, as evidenced by being listed as "COMPLETE" throughout this document. We have filed a FOIA request for any materials that might have originated during this process for all schools, so that we may evaluate how PMCH compares to other schools, as well as to what extent the evaluation process for PMCH was different from other schools.
