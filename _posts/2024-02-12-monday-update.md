## Circulating flyers, gathering feedback

We took to the street early today to circulate flyers and gather feedback from local business owners as we sought permission to post our notices. The entire purpose of this effort is to build shared understanding within the community about the PMCH situation, and we encourage members of the community to share their opinions on this matter directly. Please note if you wish your correspondence to remain private, we will not publish anything shared in confidence.

We are specifically requesting any concerns that the community might have surrounding PMCH, which we will address as best we are able on the [concerns](/concerns/) page.
