## Concerns We've Heard

### PSP doesn't own the PMCH Building, and can't make it compliant with the School Safety Plan

PMCH requested funds to update the doors through the PSP capital call being used to bring other district properties into compliance. This request was denied because the [Management Agreement](assets/files/2023-2024_Mgt_Agreement_Amendment.pdf) stipulates that PMCH is required to cover all facility costs, both for operating expenses and capital costs.

To address identified deficiencies, 5 doors were replaced, and 3 were updated. Efforts to continue to improve the building are ongoing.

Ultimately, the goal is to build a new building on the current property, which will allow for expanded services and more students. This building is expected to cost between $2.5 and $3 million, and would qualify for a low interest government loan. Efforts have already been underway to bring this plan to fruition.
