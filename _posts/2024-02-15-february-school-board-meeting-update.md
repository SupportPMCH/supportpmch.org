## An apology to Becky Smith

We would like to issue an Apology to **Becky Smith** for our careless use of a "no picture" placeholder image. We have updated the flyer in question with what we hope to be a more acceptable "no picture" placeholder image. Publicly available images of other officials were readily available and used, which was not the case with Ms. Smith. We acted in haste due to a sense of urgency, and made a poor choice of image.

In the interests of transparency, here is the original image, followed by the updated flyer with the alternative image used.

## Results of tonight's board meeting

Tonight's PSP Board meeting opened to a packed meeting hall. Overflow seating was needed, as many local citizens showed up to voice their support for PMCH. Students, parents, alumni, and even out of town people used the public comments segment to voice their various opinions and experiences with PMCH.

Once the initial public commentary segment had concluded, the board meeting proceeded as scheduled, up until the point where Dr Leslie presented the boards decision on PMCH, which was **to not entertain the renewal of the management agreement**. In this latest telling of the PSP Boards reasoning, the ultimate rationale proves to be financial interests, coupled with "personality conflicts" between the PMCH BOT and the PSP Board. This was the first time we've been presented with the personality conflict rationale, and our open letter was cited as a contributing factor in a manner suggesting that it was a manifestation of that same conflict.

We want to make it abundantly clear that **we are not PMCH BOT members**, and the writings on this site are not representative of the opinions of the PMCH BOT.

## An explanation to those whom we've offended

We wanted to speak to the people whom are offended at our pledge to investigate and expose the undercurrents that are leading to this outcome.

Elected officials are taking __drastic__ action on our behalf. When pressed for details as to why, these elected officials have provided numerous and disjointed explanations. They have refused to plainly explain their reasons, or paths for remedy. They have conducted _all deliberations_ regarding this subject in closed sessions, which are immune from FOIA requests. All while as recently as _tonight in open meeting_, laying claims to valuing transparency.

Dr Leslie himself this evening, in open session, said that he had trivial discussions with Nicky in their summer meeting, giving her the impression of continuing progress, having already made up his mind that there was no path forward.

Kathy Reed spoke at length about the difficulties posed administratively in having a licensed daycare center with elementary children in it, and spoke specifically to the PMCH agreement not being aligned with the "Business interests" of PSP. This statement was surprising enough that another citizen commented upon it specifically in the closing public comments segment.

This evenings meeting was a perfect example of the types of activities that **drove us** to pursue and alternative remedy through FOIA requests and publication. We were once again presented with a myriad of reasons, with tonight's apparently conclusion that it's **Finances** and an open letter sent **last week**.

We indulged in a lack of tact which allowed Dr Leslie to use our letter as a tool for his cause, which we deeply regret. We will endeavor to not repeat this mistake in the future. **We readily apologize for this mistake, and to those we've made uncomfortable by our tone. We will do better going forward**.

## Whats next

We're going to focus on supporting the search for a new Management partner, the efforts around building a new building, and requesting, reviewing, and publishing documents pertaining to the history of the PSP / PMCH.

Even if PSP would renew the agreement, in our observation this has been a strained relationship since the mid 2000's, and many of the same individuals have been present on the PSP Board through those most tenuous of years.

Dr Leslie is left in the awkward and unenviable position of presiding over the conclusion of over a decade of building animosity. The voices in his ear at work all week are louder than our voices in a meeting once a month. By utilizing closed sessions for all their discussion about PMCH, we're not even able to readily identify and address whom has what concerns. We've heard half a dozen distinct causes, but if we're not mistaken one of the slides Dr Leslie showed today had a bullet point that identified 32 concerns. I don't know of anywhere that specific list has been provided in an itemized way. We've not observed it in any of the documents we've collected pertaining to the PSP/PMCH agreement.

Regardless of the total number of concerns, the observation that a new one is dispensed every time the last one was addressed ( kindergarten teacher certification ring any bells? ) leads us to believe that this is just the strategy being employed until the PSP opposition accomplishes their goals of divesting of the PMCH. The existing leadership team is entrenched and not solution oriented.
