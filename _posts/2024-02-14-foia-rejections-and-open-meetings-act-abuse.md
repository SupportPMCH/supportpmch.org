## FOIA Rejections

In an unsurprising turn of events, our first round of FOIA requests have been rejected. We've made updates to address the reasons for rejection, and have re-filed amended requests as appropriate.

## Open Meetings Act Abuse

The more interesting rejection came under the defense of the Michigan Open Meetings Act, MCL 15.267(2). The full section is highlighted below.

![Your request is denied pursuant to Section 13(1)(3) of the FOIA](/assets/images/foia_rejection_MCL15.267.2.png)

### 15.267 Closed sessions; roll call vote; separate set of minutes.

Sec. 7. (1) A 2/3 roll call vote of members elected or appointed and serving is required to call a closed session, except for the closed sessions permitted under section 8(a), (b), (c), (g), (i), and (j). The roll call vote and the purpose or purposes for calling the closed session shall be entered into the minutes of the meeting at which the vote is taken.

(2) A separate set of minutes shall be taken by the clerk or the designated secretary of the public body at the closed session. **These minutes shall be retained by the clerk of the public body, are not available to the public, and shall only be disclosed if required by a civil action filed under section 10, 11, or 13**. These minutes may be destroyed 1 year and 1 day after approval of the minutes of the regular meeting at which the closed session was approved.

#### Assessment

This claim seems sound at first glance. The law is clear about the access to minutes from closed sessions. We're clearly going to have to file a lawsuit to gain access to these documents, based on the reply from PSP and their intent to use this clause as a defense.

The law is also clear about what reasons are considered permissible to move to a closed session meeting. These reasons are outlined in the very next section of the same document. We have truncated the clause at 8(h) specifically, because this is the last subsection referenced and it's a lengthy body of text.


### 15.268 Closed sessions; permissible purposes; applicability to independent citizens redistricting commission.
Sec. 8.
- (1) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (2), a public body may meet in a closed session only for the following purposes:
	- (a) To consider the dismissal, suspension, or disciplining of, or to hear complaints or charges brought against, or to consider a periodic personnel evaluation of, a public officer, employee, staff member, or individual agent, if the named individual requests a closed hearing. An individual requesting a closed hearing may rescind the request at any time, in which case the matter at issue must be considered after the rescission
	- (b) To consider the dismissal, suspension, or disciplining of a student if the public body is part of the school district, intermediate school district, or institution of higher education that the student is attending, and if the student or the student's parent or guardian requests a closed hearing.
	- (c) For strategy and negotiation sessions connected with the negotiation of a collective bargaining agreement if either negotiating party requests a closed hearing.
	- (d) To consider the purchase or lease of real property up to the time an option to purchase or lease that real property is obtained.
	- (e) To consult with its attorney regarding trial or settlement strategy in connection with specific pending litigation, but only if an open meeting would have a detrimental financial effect on the litigating or settlement position of the public body.
	-	(f) To review and consider the contents of an application for employment or appointment to a public office if the candidate requests that the application remain confidential. However, except as otherwise provided in this subdivision, all interviews by a public body for employment or appointment to a public office must be held in an open meeting pursuant to this act. This subdivision does not apply to a public office described in subdivision (j).
	- (g) Partisan caucuses of members of the state legislature.
	- **(h) To consider material exempt from discussion or disclosure by state or federal statute.**

#### Abuse

Subsection **8(h)** is of specific interest to us, because in the **August 17, 2023** meeting minutes, **8(h)** is cited by **Kathy Reed** as the specific reason for moving to closed session when she puts forward the motion to close.

> 18. Resolution: Closed Session - To Consider Material Exempt from Discussion
> Moved that the Board meet in closed session to consider material **exempt from
discussion or disclosure by state or federal statute as permitted in Section 8(h) of the Michigan Open Meetings Act**. This motion, made by Kathy Reed and seconded by
> Denise Petoskey, Passed.
> - Mark Ashley: Yea
> - Jenni Attie: Yea
> - Beth Flynn: Yea

The law provides for [9 exemptions](https://www.justice.gov/d9/what_are_the_9_foia_exemptions.pdf), summarized below:

**Department of Justice list of FOIA Exemptions**
1. Information that is classified to protect national security.
2. Information related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency.
3. Information that is prohibited from disclosure by another federal law.
4. Trade secrets or commercial or financial information that is confidential or privileged.
5. Privileged communications within or between agencies, including those protected by the:
	1. **Deliberative Process Privilege** (provided the records were created less than 25 years before the date on which they were requested)
	2. Attorney-Work Product Privilege
	3. Attorney-Client Privilege
	4. Presidential Communications Privilege
6. Information that, if disclosed, would invade another individualâ€™s personal privacy.
7. Information compiled for law enforcement purposes that:
8. Information that concerns the supervision of financial institutions.
9. Geological information on wells.

#### Deliberative Process Privilege

The Deliberative Process Privilege is a provision of law that has long been criticized as a catch-all exemption for denying public records requests. We suspect that it is going to once again be favored for that purpose with respect to all things related to the Petoskey Montessori Children's House.

Continuing to refuse to provide these documents and rest upon this provision of the law is likely fully within the rights of the PSP Board, however it makes an absolute mockery of [Dr Leslie's stated commitment to transparency](/_pages/pspstaff/jeff_leslie.html#quoting-the-article) when he was hired.

Lies are a poor foundation to build a community upon.
