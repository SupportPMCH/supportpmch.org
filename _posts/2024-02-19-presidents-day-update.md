## Happy Presidents Day

We hope everyone is enjoying the long weekend. We managed to keep busy with research efforts and some quality of life updates to the website. We don't anticipate any additional changes to the look and feel at this point. We hope to prioritize our efforts around research, writing, and publishing supporting documents.

## PMCH Weekend Email

Over the weekend, The PMCH Board of Trustee's sent an email to parents and concerned citizens. We have [published](/republished/2024/02/18/e-mail-follow-up-to-questions-from-psp-school-board-meeting.html) this email as faithfully as possible, including the images and attachments that were sent with the original email.

## First impressions

It's clear to us that the PMCH side has been feverishly seeking the support of the PSP Board for the past year. The spirit of collaboration necessary to see such an effort through is missing from the PSP side of the table. The decision to terminate support for PMCH was obviously made during last summer, was made behind closed doors, thus denying the public it's rights in the process. These decisions were made by elected officials acting on our behalf. We should not be _forced_ to use the FOIA process for what should have been an open public conversation from the start.

PMCH BOT, a group of volunteers, went to extraordinary lengths to understand how to work with PSP. From [the transcript](/assets/files/transcripts/psp_feb_15_board_meeting_transcript.txt), it's clear that Dr Leslie up until last week was still misinformed about the state of PMCH and their funding needs. We find this fact to represent a troubling dereliction of Dr Leslie's obligations to the community.

History will not forget in who's hands a nearly 25 year old agreement met its demise. We hope the community remembers who took this treasured resource from us in future election cycles. We certainly intend to do our part to remind people when the time comes.

## Next steps

We intend to file FOIA requests for the presentation Dr Leslie presented, as well as all the supporting material used in it's production. This will include any emails or other correspondence or collaboration with other parties in the development of that presentation. As always, responsive documents from these requests will be published here.
